b.1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he shall be my sonne, and I will not take my mercie
b.1CH.17.14	But I will settle him in mine house, and in my kingdom for euer, and his
b.1CH.17.15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan
b.1CH.17.16	And Dauid the king came, and sate before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord
b.1CH.17.17	And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God: for thou hast also
b.1CH.17.18	What can Dauid speake more to thee for the honour of thy seruant? for thou
b.1CH.17.19	O Lord, for thy seruants sake, and according to thine owne heart, hast thou
b.1CH.17.2	Then Nathan sayd vnto Dauid, Doe all that is in thine heart, for God is with
b.1CH.17.20	O Lord, there is none like thee neither is there any God besides thee,
b.1CH.17.21	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whome God went to
b.1CH.17.22	For thy people Israel didst thou make thine owne people for euer, and thou,
b.1CH.17.23	Therefore now Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy
b.1CH.17.24	Let it euen bee established, that thy name may bee magnified for euer,
b.1CH.17.25	For thou, O my God, hast tolde thy seruant that thou wilt build him an house:
b.1CH.17.26	And now, Lord (thou art God, and hast promised this goodnesse vnto thy
b.1CH.17.27	Now therefore let it please thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it
b.1CH.17.3	And it came to passe the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan,
b.1CH.17.4	Goe and tell Dauid my seruant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me an
b.1CH.17.5	For I haue not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought vp Israel, vnto
b.1CH.17.6	Wheresoeuer I haue walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the Iudges
b.1CH.17.7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid, Thus saith the Lord
b.1CH.17.8	And I haue bene with thee whithersoeuer thou hast walked, and haue cut off all
b.1CH.17.9	Also I will ordeine a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and
b.1CH.1.8	The sonnes of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
b.1CH.18.1	Now after this, it came to passe, that Dauid smote the Philistines &amp;
b.1CH.18.10	Hee sent Hadoram his sonne to king Dauid, to enquire of his welfare, and to
b.1CH.18.11	Them also king Dauid dedicated vnto the Lord, with the siluer and the golde
b.1CH.18.12	Moreouer, Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah, slew of the Edomites in the valley of
b.1CH.18.13	And he put garisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauids seruants.
b.1CH.18.14	So Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgement and iustice among
b.1CH.18.15	And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the hoste, and Iehoshaphat the sonne
b.1CH.18.16	And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub, and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar, were the
b.1CH.18.17	And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the Cherethites, and the
b.1CH.18.2	And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became Dauids seruants, and brought gifts.
b.1CH.18.3	And Dauid smote Hadarezer king of Zobah vnto Hamath, as hee went to stablish
b.1CH.18.4	And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and
b.1CH.18.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to helpe Hadarezer king of Zobah, Dauid
b.1CH.18.6	Then Dauid put garisons in Syria Damascus, and the Syrians became Dauids
b.1CH.18.7	And Dauid tooke the shields of golde that were on the seruants of Hadarezer,
b.1CH.18.8	Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, broght Dauid very
b.1CH.18.9	Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how Dauid had smitten all the hoste of
b.1CH.1.9	And the sonnes of Cush: Siba, and Hauilah, and Sabta, and Raamah, and Sabtecha:
b.1CH.19.1	Now it came to passe after this, that Nahash the King of the children of Ammon
b.1CH.19.10	Now when Ioab saw that the battell was set against him, before and behinde:
b.1CH.19.11	And the rest of the people hee deliuered vnto the hand of Abishai his
b.1CH.19.12	And he said, If the Syrians bee too strong for me, then thou shalt helpe me:
b.1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let vs behaue our selues valiantly for our people,
b.1CH.19.14	So Ioab and the people that were with him, drew nigh before the Syrians, vnto
b.1CH.19.15	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise
b.1CH.19.16	And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they
b.1CH.19.17	And it was tolde Dauid, and hee gathered all Israel, and passed ouer Iordane,
b.1CH.19.18	But the Syrians fled before Israel, and Dauid slew of the Syrians seuen
b.1CH.19.19	And when the seruants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before
b.1CH.19.2	And Dauid sayde, I will shewe kindnesse vnto Hanun the sonne of Nahash,
b.1CH.19.3	But the Princes of the children of Ammon sayde to Hanun, Thinkest thou that
b.1CH.19.4	Wherefore Hanun tooke Dauids seruants, and shaued them, and cut off their
b.1CH.19.5	Then there went certeine, and told Dauid, how the men were serued, and hee
b.1CH.19.6	And when the children of Ammon sawe, that they had made themselues odious to
b.1CH.19.7	So they hired thirtie and two thousand charets, and the king of Maachah and
b.1CH.19.8	And when Dauid heard of it, hee sent Ioab, and all the host of the mightie
b.1CH.19.9	And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battell in aray before the
b.1CH.20.1	And it came to passe, that after the yeere was expired, at the time that kings
b.1CH.20.2	And Dauid tooke the crowne of their king from off his head, and found it to
b.1CH.20.3	And hee brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with sawes, and
b.1CH.20.4	And it came to passe after this, that there arose warre at Gezer with the
b.1CH.20.5	And there was warre againe with the Philistines, and Elhanan the sonne of Iair,
b.1CH.20.6	And yet againe there was warre at Gath, where was a man of great stature,
b.1CH.20.7	But when he defied Israel, Ionathan the sonne of Shimea Dauids brother, slew
b.1CH.20.8	These were borne vnto the Giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of Dauid,
b.1CH.2.1	These are the sonnes of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Leui, and Iudah, Issachar, and
b.1CH.2.10	And Ram begate Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Nahshon, prince of the children
b.1CH.2.11	And Nahshon begate Salma, and Salma begate Boaz.
b.1CH.21.1	And Satan stoode vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid to number Israel.
b.1CH.21.10	Goe and tell Dauid, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things,
b.1CH.21.11	So Gad came to Dauid, and said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose thee
b.1CH.21.12	Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to bee destroyed before thy foes
b.1CH.21.13	And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a great strait. Let mee fall now into the
b.1CH.21.14	So the Lord sent pestilence vpon Israel: and there fell of Israel, seuentie
b.1CH.21.15	And God sent an Angel vnto Ierusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying,
b.1CH.21.16	And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and saw the Angel of the Lord stand betweene the
b.1CH.21.17	And Dauid said vnto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbred?
b.1CH.21.18	Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should

b.1CH.21.2	And Dauid saide to Ioab, and to the rulers of the people, Goe, number Israel
b.1CH.21.20	And Ornan turned backe and saw the Angel, and his foure sonnes with him, hid

b.1CH.21.23	And Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that
b.1CH.21.24	And king Dauid said to Ornan; Nay, but I wil verily buy it for the full
b.1CH.21.25	So Dauid gaue to Ornan for the place, sixe hundred shekels of gold by weight.
b.1CH.21.26	And Dauid built there an Altar vnto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings,
b.1CH.21.27	And the Lord commaunded the Angel, and hee put vp his sword againe into the

b.1CH.21.3	And Ioab answered, The Lord make his people an hundred times so many moe as
b.1CH.21.30	But Dauid could not goe before it to euquire of God; for he was afraid,
b.1CH.2.14	Nathanael the fourth, Raddai the fifth,
b.1CH.21.4	Neuerthelesse, the kings word preuailed against Ioab: wherefore Ioab departed,

b.1CO.10.11	Now all these things happened vnto them for ensamples: and they are written
b.1CO.10.12	Wherefore, let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.
b.1CO.10.13	There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man: but God is
b.1CO.10.14	Wherefore my dearely beloued, flee from idolatrie.
b.1CO.10.15	I speake as to wise men: iudge ye what I say.
b.1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which wee blesse, is it not the communion of the blood of
b.1CO.10.17	For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of
b.1CO.10.18	Behold
b.1CO.10.19	What say I then? that the idole is any thing? or that which is offered in
b.1CO.10.2	And were all baptized vnto Moyses in the cloud, and in the sea:
b.1CO.10.20	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to
b.1CO.10.21	Yee cannot drinke the cup of the Lord, and the cup of deuils: ye cannot be
b.1CO.10.22	Doe we prouoke the Lord to iealousie? are we stronger then he?
b.1CO.10.23	All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient: All things
b.1CO.10.24	Let no man seeke his owne: but euery man anothers wealth.
b.1CO.10.25	Whatsoeuer is solde in the shambles, that eate, asking no question for

b.1CO.10.27	If any of them that beleeue not, bid you to a feast, and yee be disposed to
b.1CO.10.28	But if any man say vnto you, This is offered in sacrifice vnto idoles, eate
b.1CO.10.29	Conscience I say, not thine owne, but of the others: for why is my libertie
b.1CO.10.3	And did all eat the same spirituall meat:
b.1CO.10.30	For, if I by grace be a partaker, why am I euill spoken of, for that for
b.1CO.10.31	Whether therfore ye eat or drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glory
b.1CO.10.32	Giue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the
b.1CO.10.33	Euen as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine owne profit, but the
b.1CO.10.4	And did all drinke the same spirituall drinke: (for they dranke of that
b.1CO.10.5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were ouerthrowen in
b.1CO.10.6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent wee should not lust after
b.1CO.10.7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written, The people

b.1CO.11.10	For this cause ought the woman to haue power on her head, because of the
b.1CO.11.11	Neuerthelesse, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman

b.1CO.11.13	Iudge in your selues, is it comely that a woman pray vnto God vncouered?
b.1CO.11.14	Doeth not euen nature it selfe teach you, that if a man haue long haire, it
b.1CO.11.15	But if a woman haue long haire, it is a glory to her: for her haire is giuen

b.1CO.11.22	What, haue ye not houses to eate and to drinke in? Or despise yee the
b.1CO.11.23	For I haue receiued of the Lord that which also I deliuered vnto you, that
b.1CO.11.24	And when he had giuen thanks, he brake it, and sayd, Take, eate, this is my

b.1CO.11.27	Wherefore, whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup of the Lord
b.1CO.11.28	But let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of that bread, and drinke
b.1CO.11.29	For hee that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to

b.1CO.11.31	For if we would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged.
b.1CO.11.32	But when we are iudged, we are chastened of the Lord, that wee should not be

b.1CO.11.34	And if any man hunger, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto
b.1CO.1.14	I thanke God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius:
b.1CO.11.4	Euery man praying or prophecying, hauing his head couered, dishonoureth his

b.1CO.12.11	But all these worketh that one and the selfe same spirit, diuiding to euery
b.1CO.12.12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the membrs of that one
b.1CO.12.13	For by one spirit are we all baptized into one bodie, whether wee bee Iewes
b.1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many.
b.1CO.12.15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body: is it
b.1CO.12.16	And if the eare shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: is
b.1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were
b.1CO.12.18	But now hath God set the members, euery one of them in the body, as it hath
b.1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where were the body?
b.1CO.1.22	For the Iewes require a signe, and the Greekes seeke after wisedome.
b.1CO.12.2	Yee know that yee were Gentiles, caryed away vnto these dumbe idoles, euen as
b.1CO.12.20	But now are they many members, yet but one body.
b.1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say vnto the hand, I haue no need of thee: nor againe, the
b.1CO.12.22	Nay, much more those members of the bodie, which seeme to bee more feeble,
b.1CO.12.23	And those members of the bodie, which wee thinke to bee lesse honourable,
b.1CO.12.24	For our comely parts haue no need: but God hath tempered the bodie together,
b.1CO.12.25	That there should be no schisme in the body: but that the members should haue
b.1CO.12.26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it: or one member
b.1CO.12.27	Now yee are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
b.1CO.12.28	And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets,
b.1CO.12.29	Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all workers of
b.1CO.1.23	But wee preach Christ crucified, vnto the Iewes a stumbling block, and vnto
b.1CO.12.3	Wherefore I giue you to vnderstand, that no man speaking by the spirit of God,
b.1CO.12.30	Haue all the gifts of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all
b.1CO.12.31	But couet earnestly the best gifts: And yet shew I vnto you a more excellent
b.1CO.1.24	But vnto them which are called, both Iewes and Greekes, Christ, the power of
b.1CO.12.4	Nowe there are diuersities of gifts, but the same spirit.
b.1CO.1.25	Because the foolishnesse of God is wiser then men: and the weakenesse of God
b.1CO.12.5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
b.1CO.1.26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the
b.1CO.12.6	And there are diuersities of operations, but it is the same God, which worketh
b.1CO.1.27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise:
b.1CO.12.7	But the manifestation of the spirit, is giuen to euery man to profit withall.
b.1CO.1.28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen,
b.1CO.12.8	For to one is giuen by the spirit, the word of wisedome, to another the word
b.1CO.1.29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.
b.1CO.12.9	To another faith, by the same spirit: to another the gifts of healing, by the
b.1CO.1.3	Grace be vnto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus
b.1CO.1.30	But of him are ye in Christ Iesus, who of God is made vnto vs wisedome, and
b.1CO.1.31	That according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
b.1CO.13.1	Though I speake with the tongues of men &amp; of Angels, and haue not charity,
b.1CO.13.10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part, shalbe
b.1CO.13.11	When I was a childe, I spake as a childe, I vnderstood as a childe, I thought
b.1CO.13.12	For now we see through a glasse, darkely: but then face to face: now I know
b.1CO.13.13	And now abideth faith, hope, charitie, these three, but the greatest of these
b.1CO.13.2	And though I haue the gift of prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and all
b.1CO.13.3	And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore, and though I giue my
b.1CO.13.4	Charitie suffereth long, and is kinde: charitie enuieth not: charitie vaunteth
b.1CO.13.5	Doeth not behaue it selfe vnseemly, seeketh not her owne, is not easily
b.1CO.13.6	Reioyceth not in iniquitie, but reioyceth in the trueth:
b.1CO.13.7	Beareth all things, beleeueth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
b.1CO.13.8	Charitie neuer faileth: but whether there be prophesies, they shall faile;
b.1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesie in part.
b.1CO.1.4	I thanke my God alwayes on your behalfe, for the grace of God which is giuen
b.1CO.14.1	Follow after charitie, and desire spirituall giftes, but rather that yee may
b.1CO.14.10	There are, it may bee, so many kindes of voices in the world, and none of
b.1CO.14.11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voyce, I shall bee vnto him that
b.1CO.14.12	Euen so ye, forasmuch as yee are zealous of spirituall gifts, seeke that yee
b.1CO.14.13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an vnknowen tongue, pray that he may
b.1CO.14.14	For if I pray in an vnknowen tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my vnderstanding
b.1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and wil pray with vnderstanding
b.1CO.14.16	Else, when thou shalt blesse with the spirit, how shall hee that occupieth
b.1CO.14.17	For thou verily giuest thankes well: but the other is not edified.
b.1CO.14.18	I thanke my God, I speake with tongues more then you all.
b.1CO.14.19	Yet in the Church I had rather speake fiue words with my vnderstanding, that
b.1CO.14.2	For he that speaketh in an vnknowen tongue, speaketh not vnto men, but vnto
b.1CO.14.20	Brethren, bee not children in vnderstanding: how be it, in malice be yee
b.1CO.14.21	In the Law it is written, With men of other tongues, and other lippes will I
b.1CO.14.22	Wherfore tongues are for a signe, not to them that beleeue, but to them that
b.1CO.14.23	If therefore the whole Church be come together into some place, and all
b.1CO.14.24	But if all prophesie, and there come in one that beleeueth not, or one
b.1CO.14.25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so falling downe on
b.1CO.14.26	How is it then brethren? when ye come together, euery one of you hath a
b.1CO.14.27	If any man speake in an vnknowen tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by
b.1CO.14.28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keepe silence in the Church, and let
b.1CO.14.29	Let the Prophets speake two or three, and let the other iudge.
b.1CO.14.3	But he that prophesieth, speaketh vnto men to edification, and exhortation,
b.1CO.14.30	If any thing be reueiled to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his
b.1CO.14.31	For yee may all prophesie one by one, that all may learne, and all may be
b.1CO.14.32	And the spirits of the Prophets are subiect to the Prophets.
b.1CO.14.33	For God is not the authour of confusion, but of peace, as in all Churches of
b.1CO.14.34	Let your women keepe silence in the Churches, for it is not permitted vnto
b.1CO.14.35	And if they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home: for
b.1CO.14.36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it vnto you onely?
b.1CO.14.37	If any man thinke himselfe to be a Prophet, or spiritual, let him
b.1CO.14.38	But if any man bee ignorant, let him be ignorant.
b.1CO.14.39	Wherefore brethren, couet to prophesie, and forbid not to speake with
b.1CO.14.4	He that speaketh in an vnknowen tongue, edifieth himselfe: but hee that
b.1CO.14.40	Let all things be done decently, and in order.
b.1CO.14.5	I would that yee all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for
b.1CO.14.6	Now brethren, if I come vnto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit
b.1CO.14.7	And euen things without life giuing sound, whether pipe or harpe, except they
b.1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet giue an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to the
b.1CO.14.9	So likewise you, except ye vtter by the tongue words easie to be vnderstood,
b.1CO.1.5	That in euery thing yee are enriched by him, in all vtterance, and in all
b.1CO.15.1	Moreouer brethren, I declare vnto you the Gospel which I preached vnto you,
b.1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed vpon
b.1CO.15.11	Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, aud so ye beleeued.
b.1CO.15.12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you,
b.1CO.15.13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen.
b.1CO.15.14	And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vaine, and your faith is
b.1CO.15.15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we haue testified of
b.1CO.15.16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised.
b.1CO.15.17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vaine, ye are yet in your sinnes.
b.1CO.15.18	Then they also which are fallen asleepe in Christ, are perished.
b.1CO.15.19	If in this life only we haue hope in Christ, wee are of all men most
b.1CO.15.2	By which also yee are saued, if yee keepe in memorie what I preached vnto you,
b.1CO.15.20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them
b.1CO.15.21	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
b.1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, euen so in Christ shall all be made aliue.
b.1CO.15.23	But euery man in his owne order. Christ the first fruits, afterward they that
b.1CO.15.24	Then commeth the end, when he shall haue deliuered vp the kingdome to God
b.1CO.15.25	For he must reigne, till hee hath put all enemies vnder his feete.
b.1CO.15.26	The last enemie that shall be destroyed, is death.
b.1CO.15.27	For he hath put all things vnder his feete; but when hee saith all things are
b.1CO.15.28	And when all things shall bee subdued vnto him, then shal the Sonne also
b.1CO.15.29	Else what shal they do, which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not
b.1CO.15.3	For I deliuered vnto you first of all, that which I also receiued, how that
b.1CO.15.30	And why stand we in ieopardy euery houre?
b.1CO.15.31	I protest by your reioycing which I haue in Christ Iesus our Lord, I die
b.1CO.15.32	If after the maner of men I haue fought with beasts at
b.1CO.15.33	Bee not deceiued: euill communications corrupt good manners.
b.1CO.15.34	Awake to righteousnesse, and sinne not: for some haue not the knowledge of
b.1CO.15.35	But some man will say, How are the dead raysed vp? and with what body doe
b.1CO.15.36	Thou foole, that which thou sowest, is not quickened except it die.
b.1CO.15.37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare
b.1CO.15.38	But God giueth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to euery seed his owne
b.1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men,
b.1CO.15.4	And that he was buried, and that he rose againe the third day according to the
b.1CO.15.40	There are also celestiall bodies, and bodies terrestriall: But the glorie of
b.1CO.15.41	There is one glory of the sunne, another of the moone, and another glorie of
b.1CO.15.42	So also is the resurrection of the dead, it is sowen in corruption, it is
b.1CO.15.43	It is sowen in dishonour, it is raysed in glorie: it is sowen in weakenesse,
b.1CO.15.44	It is sowen a naturall body, it is raised a spirituall bodie. There is a
b.1CO.15.45	And so it is written: The first man Adam was made a liuing soule, the last
b.1CO.15.46	Howbeit that was not first which is spirituall: but that which is naturall,
b.1CO.15.47	The first man is of the earth, earthy: The second man is the Lord from heauen.
b.1CO.15.48	As is the earthy, such are they that are earthy, and as is the heauenly, such
b.1CO.15.49	And as we haue borne the image of the earthy, wee shall also beare the image
b.1CO.15.5	And that he was seene of Cephas, then of the twelue.
b.1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh &amp; blood cannot inherite the kingdome
b.1CO.15.51	Behold, I shew you a mysterie: we shall not all sleepe, but wee shall all be
b.1CO.15.52	In a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, at the last trumpe, (for the
b.1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortall must put on
b.1CO.15.54	So when this corruptible shall haue put on incorruption, &amp; this mortall
b.1CO.15.55	O death, where is thy sting? O graue, where is thy victorie?
b.1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the law.
b.1CO.15.57	But thankes bee to God, which giueth vs the victorie, through our Lord Iesus
b.1CO.15.58	Therefore my beloued brethren, be yee stedfast, vnmoueable, alwayes abounding
b.1CO.15.6	And that hee was seene of aboue fiue hundred brethren at once: of whom the
b.1CO.15.7	After that, he was seen of Iames, then of all the Apostles.
b.1CO.15.8	And last of all he was seene of me also, as of one borne out of due time.
b.1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the Apostles, that am not meet to be called an Apostle
b.1CO.1.6	Euen as the Testimony of Christ was confirmed in you.
b.1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the Saints, as I haue giuen order to the
b.1CO.16.10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without feare: for hee
b.1CO.16.11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that hee
b.1CO.16.12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come vnto you with
b.1CO.16.13	Watch yee, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men: be strong.
b.1CO.16.14	Let all your things be done with charitie.
b.1CO.16.15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the
b.1CO.16.16	That ye submit your selues vnto such, and to euery one that helpeth with vs
b.1CO.16.17	I am glad of the comming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: for that
b.1CO.16.18	For they haue refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge yee them
b.1CO.16.19	The Churches of Asia salute you:
b.1CO.16.2	Upon the first day of the weeke, let euery one of you lay by him in store, as
b.1CO.16.20	All the brethren greet you: greet ye one another with an holy kisse.
b.1CO.16.21	The salutation of me Paul, with mine owne hand.
b.1CO.16.22	If any man loue not the Lord Iesus Christ, let him bee Anathema Maranatha.
b.1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you.
b.1CO.16.24	My loue be with you all in Christ Iesus, Amen.
b.1CO.16.3	And when I come, whomsoeuer you shall approue by your letters, them wil I send
b.1CO.16.4	And if it be meet that I goe also, they shall goe with me.
b.1CO.16.5	Now I wil come vnto you, when I shall passe through
b.1CO.16.6	And it may bee that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that yee may bring
b.1CO.16.7	For I will not see you now by the way, but I trust to tarry a while with you,
b.1CO.16.8	But I will tarry at
b.1CO.16.9	For a great doore and effectuall is opened vnto mee, and there are many
b.1CO.1.7	So that yee come behinde in no gift; wayting for the comming of our Lord Iesus
b.1CO.1.8	Who shall also confirme you vnto the end, that yee may be blamelesse in the
b.1CO.1.9	God is faithful by whom ye were called vnto the felowship of his Sonne Iesus
b.1CO.2.1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellencie of speech, or
b.1CO.2.10	But God hath reueiled them vnto vs by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth
b.1CO.2.11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, saue the spirit of man which is in
b.1CO.2.12	Now wee haue receiued, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
b.1CO.2.13	Which things also we speake, not in the words which mans wisedome teacheth,
b.1CO.2.14	But the naturall man receiueth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
b.1CO.2.15	But he that is spirituall, iudgeth all things, yet he himselfe is iudged of
b.1CO.2.16	For who hath knowen the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we
b.1CO.2.2	For I determined not to know any thing amog you, saue Iesus Christ, and him
b.1CO.2.3	And I was with you in weakenesse, and in feare, and in much trembling.
b.1CO.2.4	And my speech, and my preaching was not with entising words of mans wisedome,
b.1CO.2.5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdome of men, but in the power of
b.1CO.2.6	Howbeit wee speake wisedome among them that are perfect: yet not the wisedome
b.1CO.2.7	But wee speake the wisedome of God in a mysterie, euen the hidden wisedome
b.1CO.2.8	Which none of the princes of this world knewe: for had they knowen it, they
b.1CO.2.9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, neither haue entred
b.1CO.3.1	And I, brethren, could not speake vnto you as vnto spirituall, but as vnto
b.1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which is giuen vnto mee, as a wise master
b.1CO.3.11	For other foundation can no man lay, then that is laide, which is Iesus
b.1CO.3.12	Now if any man build vpon this foundation, gold, siluer, preciousstones,
b.1CO.3.13	Euery mans worke shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it,
b.1CO.3.14	If any mans worke abide which he hath built thereupon, he shal receiue a
b.1CO.3.15	If any mans worke shall bee burnt, he shall suffer losse: but he himselfe
b.1CO.3.16	Knowe yee not that yee are the
b.1CO.3.17	If any man defile the
b.1CO.3.18	Let no man deceiue himselfe: If any man among you seemeth to bee wise in this
b.1CO.3.19	For the wisedome of this world is foolishnesse with God: for it is written,
b.1CO.3.2	I haue fed you with milke, and not with meate: for hitherto yee were not able
b.1CO.3.20	And againe, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vaine.
b.1CO.3.21	Therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours.
b.1CO.3.22	Whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or
b.1CO.3.23	And yee are Christs, and Christ is Gods.
b.1CO.3.3	For ye are yet carnall: for whereas there is among you enuying, and strife,
b.1CO.3.4	For while one saieth, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are ye not
b.1CO.3.5	Who then is Paul? and who is Apollo? but ministers by whom ye beleeued, euen
b.1CO.3.6	I haue planted, Apollo watered: but God gaue the encrease.
b.1CO.3.7	So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither hee that watereth: but
b.1CO.3.8	Now hee that planteth, and hee that watereth, are one: and euery man shal
b.1CO.3.9	For wee are labourers together with God, ye are Gods husbandry, yee are Gods
b.1CO.4.1	Let a man so account of vs, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the
b.1CO.4.10	We are fooles for Christs sake, but ye are wise in Christ. We are weake, but
b.1CO.4.11	Euen vnto this present houre we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and
b.1CO.4.12	And labour, working with our owne hands: being reuiled, wee blesse: being
b.1CO.4.13	Being defamed, we intreate: we are made as the filth of the world, and are
b.1CO.4.14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloued sonnes I warne you.
b.1CO.4.15	For though you haue ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet haue yee not many
b.1CO.4.16	Wherefore I beseech you, be yee followers of me.
b.1CO.4.17	For this cause haue I sent vnto you Timotheus, who is my beloued sonne, and
b.1CO.4.18	Nowe some are puffed vp as though I would not come to you.
b.1CO.4.19	But I wil come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will knowe, not the
b.1CO.4.2	Moreouer, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithfull.
b.1CO.4.20	For the kingdome of God is not in word, but in power.
b.1CO.4.21	What will ye? Shall I come vnto you with a rod, or in loue, and in the spirit
b.1CO.4.3	But with mee it is a very small thing that I should bee iudged of you, or of
b.1CO.4.4	For I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not hereby iustified: but hee that
b.1CO.4.5	Therefore iudge nothing before the time, vntill the Lord come, who both will
b.1CO.4.6	And these things, brethren, I haue in a figure transferred to my selfe, and to
b.1CO.4.7	For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst
b.1CO.4.8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye haue reigned as kings without vs, and I
b.1CO.4.9	For I thinke that God hath set forth vs the Apostles last, as it were approued
b.1CO.5.1	It is reported commonly, that there is fornication among you, and such
b.1CO.5.10	Yet not altogether with the fornicatours of this world, or with the couetous,
b.1CO.5.11	But now I haue written vnto you, not to keepe company, if any man that is
b.1CO.5.12	For what haue I to doe to iudge them also that are without? doe not ye iudge
b.1CO.5.13	But them that are without, God iudgeth. Therefore put away from among your
b.1CO.5.2	And yee are puffed vp, and haue not rather mourned, that he that hath done
b.1CO.5.3	For I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, haue iudged alreadie,
b.1CO.5.4	In the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, when yee are gathered together, and my
b.1CO.5.5	To deliuer such a one vnto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
b.1CO.5.6	Your glorying is not good: know ye not that a little leauen leaueneth the
b.1CO.5.7	Purge out therefore the olde leauen, that ye may be a new lumpe, as ye are
b.1CO.5.8	Therefore let vs keepe the Feast, not with old leauen, neither with the leauen
b.1CO.5.9	I wrote vnto you in an Epistle, not to company with fornicators.
b.1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, hauing a matter against another, goe to law before the vniust,
b.1CO.6.10	Nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor reuilers, nor extortioners,
b.1CO.6.11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye
b.1CO.6.12	All things are lawfull vnto mee, but all things are not expedient: all things
b.1CO.6.13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meates: but God shall destroy both it
b.1CO.6.14	And God hath both raised vp the Lord, and will also raise vp vs by his owne
b.1CO.6.15	Know yee not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take
b.1CO.6.16	What, know ye not that he which is ioyned to an harlot, is one body? for two
b.1CO.6.17	But hee that is ioyned vnto the Lord, is one spirit.
b.1CO.6.18	Flee fornication: Euery sinne that a man doeth, is without the body: but he
b.1CO.6.19	What, know ye not that your body is the
b.1CO.6.2	Do ye not know that the Saints shall iudge the world? And if the world shalbe
b.1CO.6.20	For yee are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God in your body, and in
b.1CO.6.3	Know ye not that we shall iudge Angels? How much more things that perteine to
b.1CO.6.4	If then yee haue iudgements of things perteining to this life, set them to
b.1CO.6.5	I speake to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man amongst you? no
b.1CO.6.6	But brother goeth to law with brother, &amp; that before the vnbeleeuers?
b.1CO.6.7	Now therefore, there is vtterly a fault among you, because yee goe to law one
b.1CO.6.8	Nay, you do wrong and defraud, and that your brethren.
b.1CO.6.9	Know yee not that the vnrighteous shall not inherite the kingdome of God? Be
b.1CO.7.1	Now cocerning the things wherof ye wrote vnto me, It is good for a man not to
b.1CO.7.10	And vnto the married, I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife
b.1CO.7.11	But and if shee depart, let her remaine vnmaried, or be reconciled to her
b.1CO.7.12	But to the rest speake I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that
b.1CO.7.13	And the woman which hath an husband that beleeueth not, and if hee be pleased
b.1CO.7.14	For the vnbeleeuing husband is sanctified by the wife, and the vnbeleeuing
b.1CO.7.15	But if the vnbeleeuing depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not
b.1CO.7.16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt saue thy husband? or how
b.1CO.7.17	But as God hath distributed to euery man, as the Lord hath called euery one,
b.1CO.7.18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become vncircumcised: Is any
b.1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of
b.1CO.7.2	Neuerthelesse, to auoid fornication, let euery man haue his owne wife, and let
b.1CO.7.20	Let euery man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
b.1CO.7.21	Art thou called being a seruant? care not for it: but if thou maist be made
b.1CO.7.22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a seruant, is the Lords free man:
b.1CO.7.23	Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the seruants of men.
b.1CO.7.24	Brethren, let euery man wherin he is called, therein abide with God.
b.1CO.7.25	Nowe concerning virgins, I haue no commaundement of the Lord: yet I giue my
b.1CO.7.26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distresse, I say, that
b.1CO.7.27	Art thou bound vnto a wife? seeke not to bee loosed. Art thou loosed from a
b.1CO.7.28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned, and if a virgin marry, shee hath
b.1CO.7.29	But this I say, brethren, the time is short. It remaineth, that both they
b.1CO.7.3	Let the husband render vnto the wife due beneuolence: and likewise also the
b.1CO.7.30	And they that weepe, as though they wept not: and they that reioyce, as
b.1CO.7.31	And they that vse this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this
b.1CO.7.32	But I would haue you without carefulnesse. He that is vnmarried, careth for
b.1CO.7.33	But hee that is maried, careth for the things that are of the world, how he
b.1CO.7.34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin: the vnmaried woman
b.1CO.7.35	And this I speake for your owne profite, not that I may cast a snare vpon
b.1CO.7.36	But if any man thinke that he behaueth himselfe vncomely toward his virgin,
b.1CO.7.37	Neuerthelesse, hee that standeth stedfast in his heart, hauing no necessitie,
b.1CO.7.38	So then he that giueth her in mariage, doeth wel: but he that giueth her not
b.1CO.7.39	The wife is bound by the Lawe as long as her husband liueth: but if her
b.1CO.7.4	The wife hath not power of her owne body, but the husband: and likewise also
b.1CO.7.40	But shee is happier if shee sobide, after my iudgment: and I thinke also that
b.1CO.7.5	Defraud you not one the other, except it bee with consent for a time, that yee
b.1CO.7.6	But I speake this by permission, and not of commandement.
b.1CO.7.7	For I would that all men were euen as I my selfe: but euery man hath his
b.1CO.7.8	I say therefore to the vnmaried and widowes, It is good for them if they abide
b.1CO.7.9	But if they cannot conteine, let them marry: for it is better to marrie then
b.1CO.8.1	Now as touching things offered vnto idoles, wee know that wee all haue
b.1CO.8.10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge, sit at meat in the idols
b.1CO.8.11	And through thy knowledge shal the weake brother perish, for whome Christ
b.1CO.8.12	But when ye sinne so against the brethren, and wound their weake conscience,
b.1CO.8.13	Wherefore if meate make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the
b.1CO.8.2	And if any man thinke that hee knoweth any thing, hee knoweth nothing yet as
b.1CO.8.3	But if any man loue God, the same is knowen of him.
b.1CO.8.4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in
b.1CO.8.5	For though there bee that are called gods, whether in heauen or in earth (as
b.1CO.8.6	But to vs there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in
b.1CO.8.7	Howbeit there is not in euerie man that knowledge: for some with conscience of
b.1CO.8.8	But meate commendeth vs not to God: for neither if we eate, are we the better:
b.1CO.8.9	But take heed lest by any meanes, this libertie of yours become a stumbling
b.1CO.9.1	Am I not an Apostle? am I not free? haue I not seene Iesus Christ our Lord?
b.1CO.9.10	Or saith hee it altogether for our sakes? for our sakes, no doubt, this is
b.1CO.9.11	If we haue sowen vnto you spirituall things, is it a great thing if wee shall
b.1CO.9.12	If others bee partakers of this power ouer you, are not we rather?
b.1CO.9.13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things, liue of the things
b.1CO.9.14	Euen so hath the Lord ordeined, that they which preach the Gospel, should
b.1CO.9.15	But I haue vsed none of these things. Neither haue I written these things,
b.1CO.9.16	For though I preach the Gospel, I haue nothing to glorie of: for necessitie
b.1CO.9.17	For if I doe this thing willingly, I haue a reward: but if against my will, a
b.1CO.9.18	What is my reward then? verily that when I preach the Gospel, I may make the
b.1CO.9.19	For though I bee free from all men, yet haue I made my selfe seruant vnto
b.1CO.9.2	If I bee not an Apostle vnto others, yet doubtlesse I am to you: for the seale
b.1CO.9.20	And vnto the Iewes, I became as a Iew, that I might gaine the Iewes: to them
b.1CO.9.21	To them that are without Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God,
b.1CO.9.22	To the weake became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake: I am made all
b.1CO.9.23	And this I doe for the Gospels sake, that I might be partaker thereof with
b.1CO.9.24	Know yee not that they which runne in a race, runne all, but one receiueth
b.1CO.9.25	And euery man that striueth for the masterie, is temperate in all things: Now
b.1CO.9.26	I therefore so runne, not as vncertainely: so fight I, not as one that
b.1CO.9.27	But I keepe vnder my body, and bring it into subiection: lest that by any
b.1CO.9.3	Mine answere to them that doe examine me, is this:
b.1CO.9.4	Haue wee not power to eate and to drinke?
b.1CO.9.5	Haue we not power to lead about a sister a wife aswel as other Apostles, and
b.1CO.9.6	Or I onely and Barnabas, haue not we power to forbeare working?
b.1CO.9.7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his owne charges? who planteth a vineyard, and
b.1CO.9.8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the Law the same also?
b.1CO.9.9	For it is written in the Law of Moyses, Thou shalt not muzzell the mouth of
b.1JO.1.1	That which was from ye beginning, which wee haue heard, which wee haue seene
b.1JO.1.10	If we say that we haue not sinned, wee make him a liar, and his word is not
b.1JO.1.2	(For the life was manifested, and we haue seene it, and beare witnes, and shew
b.1JO.1.3	That which wee haue seene and heard, declare we vnto you, that ye also may

b.1JO.1.5	This then is the message which we haue heard of him, and declare vnto you,
b.1JO.1.6	If we say that we haue felowship with him, and walke in darkenesse, we lie,
b.1JO.1.7	But if wee walke in the light, as he is in the light, wee haue fellowship one
b.1JO.1.8	If we say that we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the trueth is not
b.1JO.1.9	If we confesse our sinnes, hee is faithfull, &amp; iust to forgiue vs our
b.1JO.2.1	My little children, these things write I vnto you, that ye sinne not. And if
b.1JO.2.10	Hee that loueth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is none occasion
b.1JO.2.11	But he that hateth his brother, is in darknesse, and walketh in darknesse,
b.1JO.2.12	I write vnto you, little children, because your sinnes are forgiuen you for
b.1JO.2.13	I write vnto you, fathers, because yee haue knowen him that is from the
b.1JO.2.14	I haue written vnto you, fathers, because ye haue knowen him that is from the
b.1JO.2.15	Loue not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loue
b.1JO.2.16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
b.1JO.2.17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but hee that doeth the will
b.1JO.2.18	Little children, it is the last time: and as yee haue heard that Antichrist
b.1JO.2.19	They went out from vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs,
b.1JO.2.2	And he is the propitiation for our sinnes: and not for ours onely, but also
b.1JO.2.20	But ye haue an vnction from the holy One, and ye know all things.
b.1JO.2.21	I haue not written vnto you, because yee know not the trueth: but because ye
b.1JO.2.22	Who is a lier, but hee that denieth that Iesus is the Christ? hee is
b.1JO.2.23	Whosoeuer denieth the Sonne, the same hath not the Father: but he that
b.1JO.2.24	Let that therefore abide in you which yee haue heard from the beginning: if
b.1JO.2.25	And this is the promise that hee hath promised vs, euen eternall life.
b.1JO.2.26	These things haue I written vnto you, concerning them that seduce you.
b.1JO.2.27	But the anointing which ye haue receiued of him, abideth in you: and yee need
b.1JO.2.28	And now, little children, abide in him, that when hee shall appeare, wee may
b.1JO.2.29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that euery one which doeth
b.1JO.2.3	And hereby wee doe knowe that we know him, if we keepe his commandements.
b.1JO.2.4	He that saith, I knowe him, and keepeth not his commandements, is a lyer, and
b.1JO.2.5	But who so keepeth his word, in him verely is the loue of God perfected:
b.1JO.2.6	He that sayeth he abideth in him, ought himselfe also so to walke, euen as he
b.1JO.2.7	Brethren, I write no new commandement vnto you, but an olde commandement which
b.1JO.2.8	Againe, a new commandement I write vnto you, which thing is true in him and in
b.1JO.2.9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkenesse
b.1JO.3.1	Beholde, what manner of loue the Father hath bestowed vpon vs, that wee should
b.1JO.3.10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the deuill:
b.1JO.3.11	For this is the message that yee heard from the beginning, that wee should
b.1JO.3.12	Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slewe his brother: and wherefore
b.1JO.3.13	Marueile not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
b.1JO.3.14	Wee know that wee haue passed from death vnto life, because wee loue the
b.1JO.3.15	Whosoeuer hateth his brother, is a murtherer, and yee knowe that no murtherer
b.1JO.3.16	Hereby perceiue wee the loue of God, because he layd downe his life for vs,
b.1JO.3.17	But who so hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother hath need, and
b.1JO.3.18	My little children, let vs not loue in word, neither in tongue, but indeede
b.1JO.3.19	And hereby wee know that wee are of the trueth, and shall assure our hearts
b.1JO.3.2	Beloued, now are we the sonnes of God, and it doeth not yet appeare, what wee
b.1JO.3.20	For if our heart condemne vs, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all
b.1JO.3.21	Beloued, if our heart condemne vs not, then haue wee confidence towards God.
b.1JO.3.22	And whatsoeuer we aske, wee receiue of him, because we keepe his commandement,
b.1JO.3.23	And this is his commandement, that we should beleeue on the Name of his Sonne
b.1JO.3.24	And hee that keepeth his commandements dwelleth in him, and hee in him: and
b.1JO.3.3	And euery man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himselfe, euen as he is
b.1JO.3.4	Whosoeuer committeth sinne, transgresseth also the lawe: for sinne is the
b.1JO.3.5	And ye know that hee was manifested to take away our sinnes, and in him is no
b.1JO.3.6	Whosoeuer abideth in him, sinneth not: whosoeuer sinneth, hath not seene him,
b.1JO.3.7	Little children, let no man deceiue you: he that doth righteousnes, is
b.1JO.3.8	He that committeth sinne, is of the deuill, for the deuill sinneth from the
b.1JO.3.9	Whosoeuer is borne of God, doth not commit sinne: for his seede remaineth in
b.1JO.4.1	Beloued, beleeue not euery spirit, but trie the spirits, whether they are of
b.1JO.4.10	Herein is loue, not that wee loued God, but that he loued vs, and sent his
b.1JO.4.11	Beloued, if God so loued vs, wee ought also to loue one another.
b.1JO.4.12	No man hath seene God at any time. If wee loue one another, God dwelleth in
b.1JO.4.13	Hereby know wee that we dwell in him and he in vs, because hee hath giuen vs
b.1JO.4.14	And we haue seene, and doe testifie, that the Father sent the Sonne to be the
b.1JO.4.15	Whosoeuer shall confesse that Iesus is the Sonne of God, God dwelleth in him,
b.1JO.4.16	And we haue knowen and beleeued the loue that God hath to vs. God is loue,
b.1JO.4.17	Herein is our loue made perfect, that wee may haue boldnesse in the day of
b.1JO.4.18	There is no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth out feare: because feare
b.1JO.4.19	We loue him: because hee first loued vs.
b.1JO.4.2	Hereby know ye the spirit of God: euery spirit that confesseth that Iesus
b.1JO.4.20	If a man say, I loue God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar. For hee that
b.1JO.4.21	And this commandement haue we from him, that he who loueth God, loue his
b.1JO.4.3	And euery Spirit that confesseth not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh,
b.1JO.4.4	Ye are of God, little children, and haue ouercome them: because greater is he
b.1JO.4.5	They are of the world: therefore speake they of the world, and the world
b.1JO.4.6	We are of God: hee that knoweth God, heareth vs: he that is not of God heareth
b.1JO.4.7	Beloued, let vs loue one another; for loue is of God: and euery one that
b.1JO.4.8	Hee that loueth not, knoweth not God: for God is loue.
b.1JO.4.9	In this was manifested the loue of God towards vs, because that God sent his
b.1JO.5.1	Whosoeuer beleeueth that Iesus is the Christ, is borne of God: and euery one
b.1JO.5.10	Hee that beleeueth on the Sonne of God, hath the witnesse in himselfe: he
b.1JO.5.11	And this is the record, that God hath giuen to vs eternall life, and this
b.1JO.5.12	Hee that hath the Sonne, hath life; and hee that hath not the Sonne, hath not
b.1JO.5.13	These things haue I written vnto you that beleeue on the Name of the Sonne of
b.1JO.5.14	And this is the confidence that we haue in him, that if wee aske any thing
b.1JO.5.15	And if we know that he heare vs, whatsoeuer wee aske, wee know that we haue
b.1JO.5.16	If any man see his brother sinne a sinne which is not vnto death, hee shall
b.1JO.5.17	All vnrighteousnes is sinne, and there is a sinne not vnto death.
b.1JO.5.18	We know that whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not: but hee that is begotten
b.1JO.5.19	And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickednesse.
b.1JO.5.2	By this wee know that wee loue the children of God, when we loue God and keepe
b.1JO.5.20	And we know that the Sonne of God is come, and hath giuen vs an vnderstanding
b.1JO.5.21	Little children, keepe your selues from Idoles. Amen
b.1JO.5.3	For this is the loue of God, that we keepe his commandements, and his
b.1JO.5.4	For whatsoeuer is borne of God, ouercommeth the world, and this is the
b.1JO.5.5	Who is he that ouercommeth the world, but he that beleeueth that Iesus is the
b.1JO.5.6	This is hee that came by water and blood, euen Iesus Christ, not by water
b.1JO.5.7	For there are three that beare record in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the
b.1JO.5.8	And there are three that beare witnesse in earth, the Spirit, and the Water,
b.1JO.5.9	If we receiue the witnesse of men, the witnesse of God is greater: for this is
b.1KI.10.1	And when the Queene of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, concerning the Name
b.1KI.10.10	And she gaue the king an hundred and twentie talents of gold, and of spices
b.1KI.10.11	And the nauie also of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from
b.1KI.10.12	And the king made of the Almug trees, pillars for the house of the Lord, and
b.1KI.10.13	And king Solomon gaue vnto the Queene of Sheba, al her desire whatsoeuer she
b.1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one yere, was sixe hundred,
b.1KI.10.15	Besides that he had of the merchant men, and of the traffique of the
b.1KI.10.16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten golde: sixe hundred
b.1KI.10.17	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold, three pound of gold went to
b.1KI.10.18	Moreouer the king made a great throne of yuorie, and ouerlaide it with the
b.1KI.10.19	The throne had sixe steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and
b.1KI.10.2	And she came to Ierusalem with a very great traine, with camels that bare
b.1KI.10.20	And twelue lions stood there on the one side and on the other vpon the sixe
b.1KI.10.21	And all king Solomons drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of
b.1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea a nauie of Tharshish, with the nauie of Hiram: once
b.1KI.10.23	So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth, for riches and for
b.1KI.10.24	And all the earth sought to Solomon, to heare his wisedom which God had put
b.1KI.10.25	And they brought euery man his present, vessels of siluer, and vessels of
b.1KI.10.26	And Solomon gathered together charets and horsemen. And hee had a thousand
b.1KI.10.27	And the king made siluer to be in Ierusalem as stones, and Cedars made he to
b.1KI.10.28	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarne: the kings
b.1KI.10.29	And a charet came vp and went out of Egypt for sixe hundred shekels of siluer,
b.1KI.10.3	And Solomon tolde her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the
b.1KI.10.4	And when the Queene of Sheba had seene all Solomons wisedome, and the house
b.1KI.10.5	And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his seruants, and the attendance
b.1KI.10.6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine owne land,
b.1KI.10.7	Howbeit, I beleeued not the words, vntill I came and mine eyes had seene it:
b.1KI.10.8	Happie are thy men, happy are these thy seruants, which stand continually
b.1KI.10.9	Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne
b.1KI.1.1	Now King Dauid was olde, and striken in yeeres, and they couered him with
b.1KI.1.10	But Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah, and the mightie men, and Solomon his
b.1KI.1.11	Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast
b.1KI.11.1	But King Solomon loued many strange women, ( together with ye daughter of
b.1KI.11.10	And had commaunded him concerning this thing, that hee should not goe after
b.1KI.11.11	Wherefore the Lord said vnto Solomon; Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and
b.1KI.11.12	Notwithstanding in thy dayes I wil not doe it, for Dauid thy fathers sake:
b.1KI.11.13	Howbeit, I wil not rend away all the kingdome: but wil giue one tribe to thy
b.1KI.11.14	And the Lord stirred vp an aduersary vnto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: hee was
b.1KI.11.15	For it came to passe when Dauid was in Edom, and Ioab the captaine of the
b.1KI.11.16	(For sixe moneths did Ioab remaine there with all Israel, vntil hee had cut
b.1KI.11.17	That Hadad fled, he and certaine Edomites of his fathers seruants with him,
b.1KI.11.18	And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran, and they tooke men with them
b.1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great fauour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gaue him to
b.1KI.1.12	Now therefore come, let mee, I pray thee, giue thee counsell, that thou

b.1KI.11.20	And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his sonne, whom Tahpenes weaned
b.1KI.11.21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that Dauid slept with his fathers, and that
b.1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said vnto him, But what hast thou lacked with mee, that, behold,
b.1KI.11.23	And God stirred him vp another aduersary: Rezon, the sonne of Eliadah, which
b.1KI.11.24	And he gathered men vnto him, and became captaine ouer a band, when Dauid
b.1KI.11.25	And he was an aduersarie to Israel all the dayes of Solomon, beside the
b.1KI.11.26	And Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomons seruant,
b.1KI.11.27	And this was the cause that hee lift vp his hand against the king: Solomon
b.1KI.11.28	And the man Ieroboam was a mightie man of valour: and Solomon seeing the
b.1KI.11.29	And it came to passe at that time when Ieroboam went out of Ierusalem, that
b.1KI.1.13	Goe, and get thee in vnto King Dauid, and say vnto him, Diddest not thou, my
b.1KI.11.3	And he had seuen hundred wiues, Princesses, and three hundred concubines: and
b.1KI.11.30	And Ahiiah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelue
b.1KI.11.31	And he said to Ieroboam, Take thee tenne pieces: for thus sayth the Lord the
b.1KI.11.32	(But hee shall haue one tribe, for my seruant Dauids sake, and for Ierusalems
b.1KI.11.33	Because that they haue forsaken mee, and haue worshipped Ashtaroth the

b.1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingdome out of his sonnes hand, and will giue it vnto
b.1KI.11.36	And vnto his sonne will I giue one tribe, that Dauid my seruant may haue a

b.1KI.11.38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken vnto all that I command thee, and wilt
b.1KI.11.39	And I will for this afflict the seed of Dauid, but not for euer.
b.1KI.1.14	Beholde, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in
b.1KI.11.4	For it came to passe when Solomon was old, that his wiues turned away his
b.1KI.11.40	Solomon sought therefore to kill Ieroboam, and Ieroboam arose, and fledde
b.1KI.11.41	And the rest of the actes of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisedome,
b.1KI.11.42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Ierusalem, ouer all Israel, was fourtie
b.1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid his
b.1KI.1.15	And Bath-sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber: and the king was very
b.1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddesse of the Zidonians, and after
b.1KI.1.16	And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeysance vnto the king: and the king said, What
b.1KI.11.6	And Solomon did euill in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the
b.1KI.1.17	And she said vnto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God vnto thine
b.1KI.11.7	Then did Solomon build an hie place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in
b.1KI.1.18	And now behold, Adoniiah reigneth; and now my lord the king, thou knowest it
b.1KI.11.8	And likewise did hee for all his strange wiues, which burnt incense and
b.1KI.1.19	And he hath slaine oxen, and fat cattell, and sheepe in abundance, and hath
b.1KI.11.9	And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the
b.1KI.1.2	Wherefore his seruants said vnto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king
b.1KI.1.20	And thou, my lord O king, the eyes of all Israel are vpon thee, that thou
b.1KI.1.21	Otherwise it shall come to passe, when my lord the king shal sleepe with his
b.1KI.12.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him
b.1KI.12.10	And the young men that were growen vp with him, spake vnto him, saying, Thus
b.1KI.12.11	And now whereas my father did lade you with a heauy yoke, I wil adde to your
b.1KI.12.12	So Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king
b.1KI.12.13	And the king answered the people roughly, and forsooke the old mens counsell
b.1KI.12.14	And spake to them after the counsell of the young men, saying, My father made
b.1KI.12.15	Wherefore the king hearkened not vnto the people: for the cause was from the
b.1KI.12.16	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkned not vnto them, the people
b.1KI.12.17	But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Iudah,
b.1KI.12.18	Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was ouer the tribute, and all Israel
b.1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of Dauid vnto this day.
b.1KI.1.22	And loe, while shee yet talked with the king, Nathan the Prophet also came
b.1KI.12.2	And it came to passe when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt,
b.1KI.12.20	And it came to passe when all Israel heard that Ieroboam was come againe,
b.1KI.12.21	And when Rehoboam was come to Ierusalem, hee assembled all the house of Iudah,
b.1KI.12.22	But the word of God came vnto Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,
b.1KI.12.23	Speake vnto Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon king of Iudah, and vnto all the
b.1KI.12.24	Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not goe vp, nor fight against your brethren the
b.1KI.12.25	Then Ieroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein, and went out
b.1KI.12.26	And Ieroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdome returne to the house
b.1KI.12.27	If this people goe vp, to doe sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Ierusalem,
b.1KI.12.28	Whereupon the king tooke counsell, and made two calues of gold, and said vnto
b.1KI.12.29	And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
b.1KI.1.23	And they tolde the king, saying, Beholde Nathan the Prophet. And when hee was
b.1KI.12.3	That they sent, and called him: and Ieroboam and all the Congregation of
b.1KI.12.30	And this thing became a sinne: for the people went to worship before the one,
b.1KI.12.31	And he made an house of hie places, and made priests of the lowest of the
b.1KI.12.32	And Ieroboam ordeined a feast in the eight moneth, on the fifteenth day of
b.1KI.12.33	So hee offered vpon the altar, which hee had made in Bethel, the fifteenth
b.1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, My lord O king, hast thou said, Adoniiah shall reigne after
b.1KI.12.4	Thy father made our yoke grieuous: now therefore, make thou the grieuous
b.1KI.1.25	For hee is gone downe this day, and hath slaine oxen, and fat cattel, and
b.1KI.12.5	And hee said vnto them, Depart yet for three daies, then come againe to me.
b.1KI.1.26	But me, euen me thy seruant, and Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of
b.1KI.12.6	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his
b.1KI.1.27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it vnto thy
b.1KI.12.7	And they spake vnto him, saying, If thou wilt be a seruant vnto this people
b.1KI.1.28	Then king Dauid answered, and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the
b.1KI.12.8	But hee forsooke the counsell of the old men, which they had giuen him, and
b.1KI.1.29	And the king sware, and said, As the Lord liueth, that hath redeemed my soule
b.1KI.12.9	And hee said vnto them, What counsell giue ye, that we may answere this
b.1KI.1.3	So they sought for a faire damosel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and
b.1KI.1.30	Euen as I sware vnto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly
b.1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reuerence to the
b.1KI.13.1	And behold, there came a man of God out of Iudah by the word of the Lord vnto
b.1KI.13.10	So he went another way, and returned not by the way that hee came to Bethel.
b.1KI.13.11	Now there dwelt an old Prophet in Bethel, and his sonne came and told him all
b.1KI.13.12	And their father said vnto them, What way went he? for his sonnes had seene
b.1KI.13.13	And hee saide vnto his sonnes, Saddle me the asse. So they sadled him the
b.1KI.13.14	And went after the man of God, and found him sitting vnder an oke; and he
b.1KI.13.15	Then hee said vnto him, Come home with me, and eate bread.
b.1KI.13.16	And he said, I may not returne with thee, nor goe in with thee: neither will
b.1KI.13.17	For it was said to mee by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor
b.1KI.13.18	He said vnto him, I am a prophet also as thou art, and an angel spake vnto me
b.1KI.13.19	So he went backe with him, and did eate bread in his house, and dranke water.
b.1KI.1.32	And king Dauid said, Call me Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and
b.1KI.13.2	And hee cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar,
b.1KI.13.20	And it came to passe as they sate at the table, that the word of the Lord
b.1KI.13.21	And he cried vnto the man of God that came from Iudah, saying, Thus saith the
b.1KI.13.22	But camest backe, and hast eaten bread, and drunke water, in the place, of
b.1KI.13.23	And it came to passe after he had eaten bread, and after hee had drunke, that
b.1KI.13.24	And when he was gone, a lyon met him by the way, and slew him: and his
b.1KI.13.25	And beholde, men passed by, and saw the carcaise cast in the way, and the
b.1KI.13.26	And when the prophet that brought him back from the way, heard thereof, he
b.1KI.13.27	And he spake to his sonnes, saying, Saddle me the asse: and they sadled him.
b.1KI.13.28	And he went and found his carcaise cast in the way, and the asse and the lyon
b.1KI.13.29	And the prophet tooke vp the carcaise of the man of God, and laid it vpon the
b.1KI.1.33	The king also saide vnto them, Take with you the seruants of your lord, and
b.1KI.13.3	And he gaue a signe the same day, saying, This is the signe which the Lord
b.1KI.13.30	And hee laid his carcaise in his owne graue, and they mourned ouer him,
b.1KI.13.31	And it came to passe after hee had buried him, that he spake to his sonnes,
b.1KI.13.32	For the saying which hee cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in
b.1KI.13.33	After this thing, Ieroboam returned not from his euill way, but made againe
b.1KI.13.34	And this thing became sinne vnto the house of Ieroboam, euen to cut it off,
b.1KI.1.34	And let Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, anoint him there King ouer
b.1KI.13.4	And it came to passe when king Ieroboam heard the saying of the man of God,
b.1KI.1.35	Then ye shall come vp after him, that hee may come and sit vpon my throne;
b.1KI.13.5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes powred out from the altar, according to
b.1KI.1.36	And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada answered the King, and said, Amen: The Lord
b.1KI.13.6	And the king answered, and said vnto the man of God, Intreat now the face of
b.1KI.1.37	As the Lord hath bene with my lord the King, euen so be he with Solomon, and
b.1KI.13.7	And the king said vnto the man of God, Come home with mee, and refresh thy
b.1KI.1.38	So Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of
b.1KI.13.8	And the man of God said vnto the king, If thou wilt giue mee halfe thine
b.1KI.1.39	And Zadok the Priest tooke an horne of oile out of the Tabernacle, and
b.1KI.13.9	For so was it charged mee by the word of the Lord, saying, Eate no bread, nor
b.1KI.1.4	And the damosell was very faire, and cherished the king, and ministred to him:
b.1KI.1.40	And all the people came vp after him, and the people piped with pipes, and
b.1KI.1.41	And Adoniiah and all the ghests that were with him, heard it as they had made
b.1KI.14.1	At that time Abiiah the sonne of Ieroboam fell sicke.
b.1KI.14.10	Therefore behold, I will bring euill vpon the house of Ieroboam, and will cut
b.1KI.14.11	Him that dieth of Ieroboam in the citie, shall the dogs eate: and him that
b.1KI.14.12	Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine owne house: and when thy feete enter
b.1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourne for him, and bury him: for he onely of Ieroboam
b.1KI.14.14	Moreouer, the Lord shall raise him vp a king ouer Israel, who shal cut off
b.1KI.14.15	For the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reede is shaken in the water, and hee
b.1KI.14.16	And hee shall giue Israel vp, because of the sinnes of Ieroboam, who did
b.1KI.14.17	And Ieroboams wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when shee
b.1KI.14.18	And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of
b.1KI.14.19	And the rest of the actes of Ieroboam, how hee warred, and how hee reigned,
b.1KI.1.42	And while hee yet spake, behold, Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar the Priest
b.1KI.14.2	And Ieroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thy selfe,
b.1KI.14.20	And the dayes which Ieroboam reigned, were two and twentie yeeres: and he
b.1KI.14.21	And Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon reigned in Iudah: Rehoboam was fourtie and
b.1KI.14.22	And Iudah did euill in the sight of the Lord, and they prouoked him to
b.1KI.14.23	For they also built them high places, and images, and groues on euery high
b.1KI.14.24	And there were also Sodomites in the land, and they did according to all the
b.1KI.14.25	And it came to passe in the fift yeere of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of
b.1KI.14.26	And he tooke away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures
b.1KI.14.27	And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them vnto
b.1KI.14.28	And it was so, when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the guard
b.1KI.14.29	Nowe the rest of the actes of Rehoboam, and all that hee did, are they not
b.1KI.1.43	And Ionathan answered, and said to Adoniiah, Uerily our lorde king Dauid hath
b.1KI.14.3	And take with thee ten loaues, and cracknels, and a cruse of honie, and goe to
b.1KI.14.30	And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam all their dayes.
b.1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the
b.1KI.1.44	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and
b.1KI.14.4	And Ieroboams wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the
b.1KI.1.45	And Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet haue anointed him king in Gihon:
b.1KI.14.5	And the Lord said vnto Ahiiah, Behold, the wife of Ieroboam commeth to aske a
b.1KI.1.46	And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdome.
b.1KI.14.6	And it was so, when Ahiiah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the
b.1KI.1.47	And moreouer, the kings seruants came to blesse our lorde king Dauid, saying,
b.1KI.14.7	Goe, tell Ieroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted
b.1KI.1.48	And also thus sayde the King, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath
b.1KI.14.8	And rent the kingdome away from the house of Dauid, and gaue it thee: and yet
b.1KI.1.49	And all the guests that were with Adoniiah, were afraid, and rose vp, and
b.1KI.14.9	But hast done euill aboue all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and
b.1KI.1.5	Then Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith exalted himselfe, saying, I wil be king:
b.1KI.1.50	And Adoniiah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold
b.1KI.1.51	And it was tolde Solomon, saying, Behold, Adoniiah feareth King Solomon: for
b.1KI.15.1	Nowe in the eighteenth yeere of king Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, reigned
b.1KI.15.10	And forty and one yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem: and his mothers name was
b.1KI.15.11	And Asa did that which was right in the eies of the Lord, as did Dauid his
b.1KI.15.12	And hee tooke away the Sodomites out of the land, and remooued all the idoles
b.1KI.15.13	And also Maachah his mother, euen her hee remoued from being Queene, because
b.1KI.15.14	But the high places were not remooued: neuerthelesse, Asa his heart was
b.1KI.15.15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things
b.1KI.15.16	And there was war betweene Asa and Baasha King of Israel all their dayes.
b.1KI.15.17	And Baasha king of Israel went vp against Iudah, and built Ramah, that he
b.1KI.15.18	Then Asa tooke all the siluer and the golde that were left in the treasures
b.1KI.15.19	There is a league betweene me and thee, and betweene my father and thy
b.1KI.1.52	And Solomon sayd, If hee will shewe himselfe a worthy man, there shall not an
b.1KI.15.2	Three yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem: and his mothers name was Maachah, the
b.1KI.15.20	So Benhadad hearkened vnto king Asa, and sent the captaines of the hosts,
b.1KI.15.21	And it came to passe when Baasha heard thereof, that hee left off building of
b.1KI.15.22	Then king Asa made a Proclamation throughout all Iudah, (none was exempted:)
b.1KI.15.23	The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and
b.1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers, in the citie
b.1KI.15.25	And Nadab the sonne of Ieroboam began to reigne ouer Israel, in the second
b.1KI.15.26	And he did euill in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his
b.1KI.15.27	And Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against
b.1KI.15.28	Euen in the third yeere of Asa king of Iudah, did Baasha slay him, and
b.1KI.15.29	And it came to passe when hee raigned, that he smote all the house Ieroboam,
b.1KI.1.53	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him downe from the Altar, and hee came
b.1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sinnes of his father, which hee had done before him:
b.1KI.15.30	Because of the sinnes of Ieroboam which he sinned, and which hee made Israel
b.1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that hee did, are they not written
b.1KI.15.32	And there was warre betweene Asa and Baasha king of Israel al their dayes.
b.1KI.15.33	In the third yeere of Asa King of Iudah, began Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah to
b.1KI.15.34	And hee did euill in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Ieroboam,
b.1KI.15.4	Neuerthelesse, for Dauids sake did the Lord his God giue him a lampe in
b.1KI.15.5	Because Dauid did that which was right in the eies of the Lord, and turned not
b.1KI.15.6	And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam all the dayes of his life.
b.1KI.15.7	Now the rest of the actes of Abiiam, and all that hee did, are they not
b.1KI.15.8	And Abiiam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the citie of Dauid:
b.1KI.15.9	And in the twentieth yeere of Ieroboam king of Israel, reigned Asa ouer Iudah.
b.1KI.1.6	And his father had not displeased him at any time, in saying, Why hast thou
b.1KI.16.1	Then the word of the Lord came to Iehu the sonne of Hanani, against Baasha,
b.1KI.16.10	And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twentie and seuenth
b.1KI.16.11	And it came to passe when hee began to reigne, assoone as hee sate on his
b.1KI.16.12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the
b.1KI.16.13	For all the sinnes of Baasha and the sinnes of Elah his sonne, by which they
b.1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the actes of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written
b.1KI.16.15	In the twentie and seuenth yeere of Asa king of Iudah, did Zimri reigne seuen
b.1KI.16.16	And the people that were encamped, heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath
b.1KI.16.17	And Omri went vp from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged
b.1KI.16.18	And it came to passe when Zimri saw that the citie was taken, that hee went
b.1KI.16.19	For his sinnes which he sinned in doing euill in the sight of the Lord, in
b.1KI.16.2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee Prince ouer my
b.1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that hee wrought, are they
b.1KI.16.21	Then were the people of Israel diuided into two parts: halfe of the people
b.1KI.16.22	But the people that followed Omri preuailed against the people that followed
b.1KI.16.23	In the thirtie and one yeere of Asa king of Iudah, began Omri to reigne ouer
b.1KI.16.24	And hee bought the hill Samaria of Shemer, for two talents of siluer, and
b.1KI.16.25	But Omri wrought euil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse then all that
b.1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Ieroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sinne
b.1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri, which he did, and his might that he shewed,
b.1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his sonne
b.1KI.16.29	And in the thirtie and eight yeere of Asa king of Iudah, began Ahab the sonne
b.1KI.16.3	Behold, I will take away the posteritie of Baasha, and the posteritie of his
b.1KI.16.30	And Ahab the sonne of Omri did euill in the sight of the Lord, aboue all that
b.1KI.16.31	And it came to passe, as if it had beene a light thing for him to walke in
b.1KI.16.32	And hee reared vp an Altar for Baal, in the house of Baal, which hee had
b.1KI.16.33	And Ahab made a groue, and Ahab did more to prouoke the Lord God of Israel to
b.1KI.16.34	In his dayes did Hiel the Bethelite build Iericho: he laid the foundation
b.1KI.16.4	Him that dieth of Baasha in the citie, shall the dogs eate: and him that dieth
b.1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the actes of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they
b.1KI.16.6	So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his sonne
b.1KI.16.7	And also by the hand of the prophet Iehu the sonne of Hanani, came the word of
b.1KI.16.8	In the twentieth and sixt yeere of Asa king of Iudah, began Elah the sonne of
b.1KI.16.9	And his seruant Zimri (captaine of halfe his charets) conspired against him as
b.1KI.1.7	And hee conferred with Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
b.1KI.17.1	And Eliiah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said vnto Ahab,
b.1KI.17.10	So he arose, and went to Zarephath: and when he came to the gate of the citie,
b.1KI.17.11	And as shee was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring mee, I
b.1KI.17.12	And she said, As the Lord thy God liueth, I haue not a cake, but an handfull
b.1KI.17.13	And Eliiah said vnto her, Feare not, goe, and doe as thou hast said: but make
b.1KI.17.14	For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrell of meale shall not waste,
b.1KI.17.15	And shee went, and did according to the saying of Eliiah: and she, and he,
b.1KI.17.16	And the barrell of meale wasted not, neither did the cruse of oyle faile,
b.1KI.17.17	And it came to passe after these things, that the sonne of the woman, the
b.1KI.17.18	And shee sayd vnto Eliiah, What haue I to doe with thee? O thou man of God!
b.1KI.17.19	And he said vnto her, Giue me thy sonne. And he tooke him out of her bosome,
b.1KI.17.2	And the worde of the Lord came vnto him, saying,
b.1KI.17.20	And hee cried vnto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also brought
b.1KI.17.21	And he stretched himselfe vpon the child three times, and cried vnto the
b.1KI.17.22	And the Lord heard the voice of Eliiah, and the soule of the child came into
b.1KI.17.23	And Eliiah tooke the childe, and brought him downe out of the chamber into
b.1KI.17.24	And the woman said to Eliiah, Now by this I know, that thou art a man of God,
b.1KI.17.3	Get thee hence, and turne thee Eastward, and hide thy selfe by the brooke
b.1KI.17.4	And it shall bee, that thou shalt drinke of the brooke, and I haue commanded
b.1KI.17.5	So hee went, and did according vnto the word of the Lord: for hee went and
b.1KI.17.6	And the rauens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh
b.1KI.17.7	And it came to passe after a while, that the brooke dryed vp, because there
b.1KI.17.8	And the word of the Lord came vnto him, saying,
b.1KI.17.9	Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there:
b.1KI.1.8	But Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and Nathan the
b.1KI.18.1	And it came to passe after many daies, that the word of the Lord came to
b.1KI.18.10	As the Lord thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdome, whither my lord
b.1KI.18.11	And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here.
b.1KI.18.12	And it shall come to passe, as soone as I am gone from thee, that the spirit
b.1KI.18.13	Was it not told my lord, what I did when Iezebel slew the Prophets of the
b.1KI.18.14	And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here: and hee
b.1KI.18.15	And Eliiah said, As the Lord of hostes liueth, before whom I stand, I will
b.1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to meete Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meete Eliiah.
b.1KI.18.17	And it came to passe when Ahab saw Eliiah, that Ahab saide vnto him, Art thou
b.1KI.18.18	And hee answered, I haue not troubled Israel, but thou and thy fathers house,
b.1KI.18.19	Now therefore send, and gather to mee all Israel vnto mount Carmel, and the
b.1KI.18.2	And Eliiah went to shew himselfe vnto Ahab, and there was a sore famine in
b.1KI.18.20	So Ahab sent vnto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets
b.1KI.18.21	And Eliiah came vnto all the people, and said, how long halt yee betweene two
b.1KI.18.22	Then said Eliiah vnto the people, I, euen I onely remaine a Prophet of the
b.1KI.18.23	Let them therefore giue vs two bullocks, and let them chuse one bullocke for
b.1KI.18.24	And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the Name of the
b.1KI.18.25	And Eliiah said vnto the prophets of Baal, Chuse you one bullocke for your
b.1KI.18.26	And they took the bullocke which was giuen them, and they dressed it, and
b.1KI.18.27	And it came to passe at noone, that Eliiah mocked them, and saide, Crie
b.1KI.18.28	And they cried loud, and cut themselues after their maner, with kniues, and
b.1KI.18.29	And it came to passe when midday was past, and they prophesied vntil the time
b.1KI.18.3	And Ahab called Obadiah which was the gouernour of his house: (now Obadiah
b.1KI.18.30	And Eliiah said vnto all the people, Come neere vnto me. And all the people
b.1KI.18.31	And Eliiah tooke twelue stones, according to the number of the tribes of the
b.1KI.18.32	And with the stones hee built an altar in the Name of the Lord, and hee made
b.1KI.18.33	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullocke in pieces, and laide him
b.1KI.18.34	And hee said, Doe it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he
b.1KI.18.35	And the water ran round about the altar, and hee filled the trench also with
b.1KI.18.36	And it came to passe at the time of the offering of the euening sacrifice,
b.1KI.18.37	Heare me, O Lord, heare me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord
b.1KI.18.38	Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the
b.1KI.18.39	And when all the people sawe it, they fell on their faces: and they saide,
b.1KI.18.4	For it was so, when Iezebel cut off the Prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah
b.1KI.18.40	And Eliiah saide vnto them, Take the prophets of Baal, let not one of them
b.1KI.18.41	And Eliiah said vnto Ahab, Get thee vp, eate and drinke, for there is a sound
b.1KI.18.42	So Ahab went vp to eate and to drinke, and Eliiah went vp to the top of
b.1KI.18.43	And said to his seruant, Goe vp now, looke toward the Sea. And hee went vp,
b.1KI.18.44	And it came to passe at the seuenth time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth
b.1KI.18.45	And it came to passe in the meane while, that the heauen was blacke with
b.1KI.18.46	And the hand of the Lord was on Eliiah; and hee girded vp his loynes, and
b.1KI.18.5	And Ahab said vnto Obadiah, Goe into the land, vnto all fountaines of water,
b.1KI.18.6	So they diuided the land betweene them to passe throughout it: Ahab went one
b.1KI.18.7	And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Eliiah met him: and hee knew him, and
b.1KI.18.8	And he answered him, I am: goe, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here.
b.1KI.18.9	And he said, What haue I sinned, that thou wouldest deliuer thy seruant into
b.1KI.1.9	And Adoniiah slew sheepe, and oxen, and fat cattell, by the stone of Zoheleth,
b.1KI.19.1	And Ahab told Iezebel all that Eliiah had done, and withall, how hee had
b.1KI.19.10	And hee sayd, I haue beene very iealous for the Lord God of hostes: for the
b.1KI.19.11	And he sayd, Goe forth, and stand vpon the mount before the Lord. And beholde,
b.1KI.19.12	And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire: and after
b.1KI.19.13	And it was so, when Eliiah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle,
b.1KI.19.14	And he sayd, I haue beene very iealous for the Lord God of hostes, because
b.1KI.19.15	And the Lord sayd vnto him, Goe, returne on thy way to the wildernesse of
b.1KI.19.16	And Iehu the sonne of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to bee king ouer Israel: and
b.1KI.19.17	And it shall come to passe, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael, shall
b.1KI.19.18	Yet I haue left me seuen thousand in Israel, all the knees which haue not
b.1KI.19.19	So hee departed thence and found Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, who was plowing
b.1KI.19.2	Then Iezebel sent a messenger vnto Eliiah, saying; So let the gods do to me,
b.1KI.19.20	And he left the oxen, and ranne after Eliiah, and said, Let mee, I pray thee,
b.1KI.19.21	And he returned backe from him, and tooke a yoke of oxen, &amp; slew them,
b.1KI.19.3	And when he saw that, hee arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba,
b.1KI.19.4	But he himselfe went a dayes iourney into the wildernesse, and came and sate
b.1KI.19.5	And as hee lay and slept vnder a Iuniper tree, behold then, an Angel touched
b.1KI.19.6	And he looked, and behold, there was a cake baken on the coales, and a cruse
b.1KI.19.7	And the Angel of the Lord came againe the second time, and touched him, and
b.1KI.19.8	And hee arose, and did eate and drinke, and went in the strength of that meate
b.1KI.19.9	And he came thither vnto a caue, and lodged there, and behold, the word of the
b.1KI.20.1	And Benhadad the King of Syria gathered all his hoste together, and there were
b.1KI.20.10	And Benhadad sent vnto him, and said, The gods doe so vnto me and more also,
b.1KI.20.11	And the king of Israel answered, and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth
b.1KI.20.12	And it came to passe, when Benhadad heard this message (as hee was drinking,
b.1KI.20.13	And behold, there came a Prophet vnto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith
b.1KI.20.14	And Ahab saide, By whom? and he saide, Thus saith the Lord, Euen by the young
b.1KI.20.15	Then he numbred the young men of the Princes of the prouinces, and they were
b.1KI.20.16	And they went out at noone: But Benhadad was drinking himselfe drunke in the
b.1KI.20.17	And the young men of the Princes of the Prouinces went out first, and
b.1KI.20.18	And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them aliue: or whether
b.1KI.20.19	So these yong men of the princes of the prouinces, came out of the citie, and
b.1KI.20.2	And hee sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and saide vnto
b.1KI.20.20	And they slew euery one his man: and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued
b.1KI.20.21	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and charets, and slewe
b.1KI.20.22	And the Prophet came to the king of Israel, and said vnto him, Goe,
b.1KI.20.23	And the seruants of the King of Syria said vnto him, Their gods are gods of
b.1KI.20.24	And doe this thing, Take the kings away, euery man out of his place, and put
b.1KI.20.25	And number thee an armie, like the armie that thou hast lost, horse for
b.1KI.20.26	And it came to passe at the returne of the yeere, that Benhadad numbred the
b.1KI.20.27	And the children of Israel were numbred, and were all present, and went
b.1KI.20.28	And there came a man of God, and spake vnto the king of Israel, and sayd,
b.1KI.20.29	And they pitched one ouer against the other seuen daies, and so it was, that
b.1KI.20.3	Thy siluer and thy gold is mine, thy wiues also, and thy children, euen the
b.1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek, into the citie, and there a wall fell vpon
b.1KI.20.31	And his seruants said vnto him, Behold now, wee haue heard that the kings of
b.1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loynes, and put ropes on their heads, and
b.1KI.20.33	Now the men did diligently obserue whether any thing would come from him, and
b.1KI.20.34	And Benhadad said vnto him, The cities which my father tooke from thy father,
b.1KI.20.35	And a certaine man of the sonnes of the Prophets, saide vnto his neighbour in
b.1KI.20.36	Then said he vnto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voyce of the Lord,
b.1KI.20.37	Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote
b.1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised
b.1KI.20.39	And as the king passed by, he cried vnto the king: and he saide, Thy seruant
b.1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered, and said, My lord O king, according to thy
b.1KI.20.40	And as thy seruant was busie here and there, he was gone. And the king of
b.1KI.20.41	And he hasted, and tooke the ashes away from his face, and the king of Israel
b.1KI.20.42	And hee said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let goe out of
b.1KI.20.43	And the king of Israel went to his house, heauie, and displeased, and came to
b.1KI.20.5	And the messengers came againe, and saide, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying,
b.1KI.20.6	Yet I will send my seruants vnto thee to morrow about this time, and they
b.1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the Elders of the land, and saide; Marke, I
b.1KI.20.8	And all the Elders, and all the people said vnto him; Hearken not vnto him,
b.1KI.20.9	Wherefore hee said vnto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All
b.1KI.2.1	Now the dayes of Dauid drew nigh, that he should die, and he charged Solomon
b.1KI.2.10	So Dauid slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid.
b.1KI.2.11	And the dayes that Dauid raigned ouer Israel, were fourty yeeres: seuen
b.1KI.21.1	And it came to passe after these things, that Naboth the Iezreelite had a
b.1KI.21.10	And set two men, sonnes of Belial before him, to beare witnes against him,
b.1KI.21.11	And the men of his citie, euen the Elders and the Nobles who were the
b.1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
b.1KI.21.13	And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sate before him: and the
b.1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Iezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
b.1KI.21.15	And it came to passe when Iezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead,
b.1KI.21.16	And it came to passe when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose vp
b.1KI.21.17	And the word of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,
b.1KI.21.18	Arise, goe downe to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold,
b.1KI.21.19	And thou shalt speake vnto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou
b.1KI.2.12	Then sate Solomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was
b.1KI.21.2	And Ahab spake vnto Naboth, saying, Giue me thy vineyard, that I may haue it
b.1KI.21.20	And Ahab said to Eliiah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemie? And he answered,
b.1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring euill vpon thee, and will take away thy posteritie, and
b.1KI.21.22	And will make thine house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and
b.1KI.21.23	And of Iezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eate Iezebel by
b.1KI.21.24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the citie, the dogs shall eate: and him that dieth
b.1KI.21.25	But there was none like vnto Ahab, which did sell himselfe to worke
b.1KI.21.26	And hee did very abominably in following Idoles, according to all things as
b.1KI.21.27	And it came to passe when Ahab heard those wordes, that hee rent his clothes,
b.1KI.21.28	And the word of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,
b.1KI.21.29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himselfe before mee? because hee humbleth
b.1KI.2.13	And Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
b.1KI.21.3	And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it mee, that I should giue the
b.1KI.2.14	He said moreouer, I haue somewhat to say vnto thee. And she saide, Say on.
b.1KI.21.4	And Ahab came into his house, heauie, and displeased, because of the word
b.1KI.2.15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdome was mine, and that all Israel set
b.1KI.21.5	But Iezebel his wife came to him, and said vnto him, Why is thy spirit so sad,
b.1KI.2.16	And now I aske one petition of thee, deny me not. And she saide vnto him, Say
b.1KI.21.6	And he said vnto her, Because I spake vnto Naboth the Iezreelite, and said
b.1KI.2.17	And hee saide, Speake, I pray thee, vnto Solomon the king (for hee will not
b.1KI.21.7	And Iezebel his wife saide vnto him, Doest thou now gouerne the kingdome of
b.1KI.2.18	And Bathsheba said, Wel, I will speake for thee vnto the king.
b.1KI.21.8	So shee wrote letters in Ahabs name, and sealed them with his seale, and sent
b.1KI.2.19	Bathsheba therefore went vnto king Solomon, to speake vnto him for Adoniiah:
b.1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaime a fast, and set Naboth on high
b.1KI.2.2	I goe the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thy selfe a
b.1KI.2.20	Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee, I pray thee say me not
b.1KI.2.21	And she saide, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adoniiah thy brother to
b.1KI.22.1	And they continued three yeeres without warre betweene Syria and Israel.
b.1KI.22.10	And the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah sate each on his
b.1KI.22.11	And Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah made him hornes of yron: and he sayd,
b.1KI.22.12	And all the Prophets prophecied so, saying; Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead, and
b.1KI.22.13	And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah, spake vnto him, saying,
b.1KI.22.14	And Micaiah sayde, As the Lord liueth, what the Lord saith vnto me, that will
b.1KI.22.15	So he came to the king, and the king sayd vnto him, Micaiah, shall wee goe
b.1KI.22.16	And the king said vnto him, How many times shall I adiure thee, that thou
b.1KI.22.17	And hee sayd, I saw all Israel scattered vpon the hilles, as sheepe that haue
b.1KI.22.18	And the King of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he
b.1KI.22.19	And he said, Heare thou therefore the word of the Lord: I sawe the Lord
b.1KI.2.22	And king Solomon answered, and said vnto his mother, And why doest thou aske
b.1KI.22.2	And it came to passe on the third yere, that Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah
b.1KI.22.20	And the Lord said, Who shall perswade Ahab, that hee may goe vp and fall at
b.1KI.22.21	And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will
b.1KI.22.22	And the Lord said vnto him, Wherewith? And hee sayd, I will goe foorth, and I
b.1KI.22.23	Now therfore behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
b.1KI.22.24	But Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah went neere, and smote Micaiah on the
b.1KI.22.25	And Micaiah sayde, Beholde, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt goe
b.1KI.22.26	And the King of Israel sayde, Take Micaiah, and cary him backe vnto Amon the
b.1KI.22.27	And say, Thus sayth the King, Put this fellow in the prison, and feede him
b.1KI.22.28	And Micaiah saide, If thou returne at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken
b.1KI.22.29	So the King of Israel, and Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah, went vp to Ramoth
b.1KI.2.23	Then king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God doe so to me, and more also,
b.1KI.22.3	(And the king of Israel said vnto his seruants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead
b.1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, I wil disguise my selfe, &amp;
b.1KI.22.31	But the King of Syria commanded his thirtie and two Captaines that had rule
b.1KI.22.32	And it came to passe, when the captaines of the charets saw Iehoshaphat, that
b.1KI.22.33	And it came to passe, when the captaines of the charets perceiued that it was
b.1KI.22.34	And a certaine man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel
b.1KI.22.35	And the battell increased that day: and the king was stayed vp in his charet
b.1KI.22.36	And there went a proclamation throughout the hoste, about the going downe of
b.1KI.22.37	So the King died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in
b.1KI.22.38	And one washed the charet in the poole of Samaria, and the dogges licked vp
b.1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the actes of Ahab, and all that he did, and the Iuory house
b.1KI.2.24	Now therefore as the Lord liueth, which hath established mee, and set mee on
b.1KI.22.4	And hee said vnto Iehoshaphat, Wilt thou goe with me to battel to Ramoth
b.1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead.
b.1KI.22.41	And Iehoshaphat the sonne of Asa began to reigne ouer Iudah in the fourth
b.1KI.22.42	Iehoshaphat was thirtie and fiue yeeres olde when hee began to reigne, and he
b.1KI.22.43	And he walked in all the wayes of Asa his father, hee turned not aside from
b.1KI.22.44	And Iehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
b.1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat, and his might that hee shewed, and
b.1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the Sodomites which remained in the dayes of his father
b.1KI.22.47	There was then no king in Edom: a deputie was king.
b.1KI.22.48	Iehoshaphat made shippes of Tharshish to goe to Ophir for golde: but they
b.1KI.22.49	Then said Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab vnto Iehoshaphat, Let my seruants goe
b.1KI.2.25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and he
b.1KI.22.5	And Iehoshaphat said vnto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the
b.1KI.22.50	And Iehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
b.1KI.22.51	Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria the
b.1KI.22.52	And he did euill in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his
b.1KI.22.53	For he serued Baal, and worshipped him, and prouoked to anger the Lord God of
b.1KI.2.26	And vnto Abiathar the Priest saide the King, Get thee to Anathoth, vnto thine
b.1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about foure hundred
b.1KI.2.27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from beeing Priest vnto the Lord: that hee
b.1KI.22.7	And Iehoshaphat said, Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord besides, that we
b.1KI.2.28	Then tidings came to Ioab (for Ioab had turned after Adoniiah, though hee
b.1KI.22.8	And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, There is yet one man, (Micaiah
b.1KI.2.29	And it was told king Solomon that Ioab was fled vnto the Tabernacle of the
b.1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called an Officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the
b.1KI.2.3	And keepe the charge of the Lord thy God, to walke in his wayes, to keepe his
b.1KI.2.30	And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord, and said vnto him, Thus saith
b.1KI.2.31	And the king saide vnto him, Doe as he hath said, and fall vpon him, and bury
b.1KI.2.32	And the Lord shall returne his blood vpon his owne head, who fell vpon two
b.1KI.2.33	Their blood shall therefore returne vpon the head of Ioab, and vpon the head
b.1KI.2.34	So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, and fell vpon him, and slewe him,
b.1KI.2.35	And the king put Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada in his roome ouer the hoste,
b.1KI.2.36	And the king sent, and called for Shimei, and said vnto him, Build thee an
b.1KI.2.37	For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, &amp; passest ouer the
b.1KI.2.38	And Shimei said vnto the King, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath

b.1KI.2.4	That the Lord may continue his word which hee spake concerning me, saying, If
b.1KI.2.40	And Shimei arose, and sadled his asse, and went to Gath to Achish, to seeke
b.1KI.2.41	And it was told Solomon, that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath, and was
b.1KI.2.42	And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said vnto him, Did I not make
b.1KI.2.43	Why then hast thou not kept the Oath of the Lord, and the commandement that I
b.1KI.2.44	The king said moreuer to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickednesse which thine
b.1KI.2.45	And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of Dauid shall bee
b.1KI.2.46	So the king commaunded Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, which went out, and
b.1KI.2.5	Moreouer thou knowest also what Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah did to mee, and what
b.1KI.2.6	Doe therefore according to thy wisedome, and let not his hoare head goe downe
b.1KI.2.7	But shewe kindnesse vnto the sonnes of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them

b.1KI.2.9	Nowe therefore holde him not guiltlesse: for thou art a wise man, and knowest
b.1KI.3.1	And Solomon made affinitie with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tooke Pharaohs
b.1KI.3.10	And the speach pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
b.1KI.3.11	And God said vnto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked
b.1KI.3.12	Behold, I haue done according to thy word: loe, I haue giuen thee a wise and
b.1KI.3.13	And I haue also giuen thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and
b.1KI.3.14	And if thou wilt walke in my wayes, to keepe my Statutes and my Commandements,
b.1KI.3.15	And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dreame: and he came to Ierusalem, and
b.1KI.3.16	Then came there two women that were harlots, vnto the king, and stood before
b.1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house, and I
b.1KI.3.18	And it came to passe the third day after that I was deliuered, that this
b.1KI.3.19	And this womans childe died in the night: because she ouerlaid it.
b.1KI.3.2	Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built
b.1KI.3.20	And shee arose at midnight, and tooke my sonne from beside me, while thine
b.1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to giue my childe sucke, behold, it was dead:
b.1KI.3.22	And the other woman said, Nay, but the liuing is my sonne, and the dead is
b.1KI.3.23	Then said the King, The one saith, This is my sonne, that liueth, and thy
b.1KI.3.24	And the King said, Bring mee a sword. And they brought a sword before the
b.1KI.3.25	And the king said, Diuide the liuing childe in two, and giue halfe to the
b.1KI.3.26	Then spake the woman whose the liuing childe was, vnto the king, (for her
b.1KI.3.27	Then the King answered and said, Giue her the liuing child, and in no wise
b.1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of the Iudgement which the king had iudged, and they
b.1KI.3.3	And Solomon loued the Lord, walking in the statutes of Dauid his father: onely
b.1KI.3.4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high
b.1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dreame by night: and God sayd,
b.1KI.3.6	And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant Dauid my father great
b.1KI.3.7	And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy seruant King in stead of Dauid my

b.1KI.7.35	And in the top of the base was there a round compasse of halfe a cubite high:
b.1KI.7.36	For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he

b.1KI.8.10	And it came to passe when the Priests were come out of the holy place, that
b.1KI.8.11	So that the Priests could not stand to minister, because of the cloud: for
b.1KI.8.12	Then spake Solomon; The Lord said that hee would dwell in the thicke

b.1KI.8.18	And the Lord sayd vnto Dauid my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to
b.1KI.8.19	Neuerthelesse, thou shalt not build the house, but thy sonne that shall come
b.1KI.8.2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselues vnto king Solomon, at the
b.1KI.8.20	And the Lord hath perfourmed his word that he spake, and I am risen vp in the
b.1KI.8.21	And I haue set there a place for the Arke, wherein is the Couenant of the

b.1PE.2.21	For euen hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for vs,
b.1PE.2.22	Who did no sinne, neither was guile found in his mouth.
b.1PE.2.23	Who when hee was reuiled, reuiled not againe; when hee suffered, hee

b.1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous, and his eares are open vnto
b.1PE.3.13	And who is hee that will harme you, if ye bee followers of that which is

b.1SA.10.10	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of the prophets met
b.1SA.10.11	And it came to passe when all that knew him beforetime, saw, that behold, hee
b.1SA.10.12	And one of the same place answered, and sayd, But who is their father?
b.1SA.10.13	And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
b.1SA.10.14	And Sauls vncle saide vnto him, and to his seruant, Whither went ye? And he
b.1SA.10.15	And Sauls vncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said vnto you.
b.1SA.10.16	And Saul sayd vnto his vncle; He told vs plainely that the asses were found.
b.1SA.10.17	And Samuel called the people together vnto the Lord to Mizpeh;
b.1SA.10.18	And said vnto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I
b.1SA.10.19	And ye haue this day reiected your God, who himselfe saued you out of all
b.1SA.10.2	When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachels
b.1SA.10.20	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come neere, the tribe
b.1SA.10.21	When he had caused the tribe of Beniamin to come neere by their families, the
b.1SA.10.22	Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet come
b.1SA.10.23	And they ranne, and fetched him thence, and when he stood among the people,
b.1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whome the Lord hath chosen,
b.1SA.10.25	Then Samuel tolde the people the maner of the kingdome, and wrote it in a

b.1SA.10.27	But the children of Belial sayd, Howe shall this man saue vs? and they
b.1SA.10.3	Then shalt thou goe on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plaine

b.1SA.1.11	And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hostes, if thou wilt indeed looke on
b.1SA.11.1	Then Nahash the Ammonite came vp, and encamped against Iabesh Gilead: and all
b.1SA.11.10	Therfore the men of Iabesh said, To morrow wee will come out vnto you, and ye
b.1SA.11.11	And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three copanies, and
b.1SA.11.12	And the people said vnto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reigne ouer
b.1SA.11.13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the
b.1SA.11.14	Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let vs goe to Gilgal, and renew the

b.1SA.1.13	Now Hannah, shee spake in her heart; onely her lippes mooued, but her voice
b.1SA.11.3	And the Elders of Iabesh sayd vnto him, Giue vs seuen daies respite, that we
b.1SA.1.14	And Eli said vnto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from
b.1SA.11.4	Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the eares
b.1SA.1.15	And Hannah answered, and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowfull
b.1SA.11.5	And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field, and Saul sayd, What
b.1SA.1.16	Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance
b.1SA.11.6	And the Spirit of God came vpon Saul, when he heard those tydings, and his
b.1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered, and said, Goe in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee
b.1SA.11.7	And he tooke a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them
b.1SA.1.18	And she said, Let thine handmaid finde grace in thy sight. So the woman went
b.1SA.11.8	And when he numbred them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred
b.1SA.1.19	And they rose vp in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and
b.1SA.11.9	And they said vnto the messengers that came, Thus shall yee say vnto the men
b.1SA.1.2	And he had two wiues, the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the
b.1SA.1.20	Wherefore it came to passe when the time was come about, after Hannah had
b.1SA.1.21	And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went vp to offer vnto the Lord the
b.1SA.12.1	And Samuel saide vnto all Israel, Beholde, I haue hearkned vnto your voice in
b.1SA.12.10	And they cried vnto the Lord, and said, Wee haue sinned, because we haue
b.1SA.12.11	And the Lord sent Ierubbaal, and Bedan, and Iephthah, and Samuel, and
b.1SA.12.12	And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against
b.1SA.12.13	Now therefore, behold the King whom yee haue chosen, and whom yee haue
b.1SA.12.14	If ye will feare the Lord, and serue him, and obey his voice, and not rebell
b.1SA.12.15	But if ye wil not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the
b.1SA.12.16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing which the Lord will doe before
b.1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat haruest to day? I will call vnto the Lord, and hee shall send
b.1SA.12.18	So Samuel called vnto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and raine that day:
b.1SA.12.19	And all the people said vnto Samuel, Pray for thy seruants vnto the Lord thy
b.1SA.1.22	But Hannah went not vp; for shee said vnto her husband, I will not goe vp
b.1SA.12.2	And now behold, the King walketh before you: and I am olde, and gray headed,
b.1SA.12.20	And Samuel saide vnto the people, Feare not: (ye haue done al this
b.1SA.12.21	And turne ye not aside, for then should ye goe after vaine things, which
b.1SA.12.22	For the Lord wil not forsake his people, for his great Names sake: because it
b.1SA.12.23	Moreouer, as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord, in
b.1SA.12.24	Onely feare the Lord, and serue him in trueth with all your heart: for
b.1SA.12.25	But if yee shall still doe wickedly, yee shall be consumed, both yee and your
b.1SA.1.23	And Elkanah her husband said vnto her, Do what seemeth thee good, tary vntill
b.1SA.12.3	Behold, here I am, witnesse against me before the Lord, and before his
b.1SA.1.24	And when shee had weaned him, shee tooke him vp with her, with three
b.1SA.12.4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded vs, nor oppressed vs, neither hast thou
b.1SA.1.25	And they slew a bullocke, and brought the childe to Eli.
b.1SA.12.5	And hee said vnto them, The Lord is witnesse against you, and his Anointed is
b.1SA.1.26	And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soule liueth, my lord, I am the woman, that
b.1SA.12.6	And Samuel said vnto the people, It is the Lord that aduanced Moses and Aaron,
b.1SA.1.27	For this childe I prayed, and the Lord hath giuen me my petition, which I
b.1SA.12.7	Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord, of all
b.1SA.1.28	Therefore also I haue lent him to the Lord as long as hee liueth, he shall be

b.1SA.12.9	And when they forgat the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera
b.1SA.1.3	And this man went vp out of his citie yeerely, to worship and to sacrifice
b.1SA.13.1	Saul reigned one yeere, and when he had reigned two yeeres ouer Israel,
b.1SA.13.10	And it came to passe that assoone as he had made an end of offering the burnt
b.1SA.13.11	And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I sawe that the
b.1SA.13.12	Therfore said I, The Philistines will come downe now vpon me to Gilgal, and I
b.1SA.13.13	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the
b.1SA.13.14	But now thy kingdome shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after
b.1SA.13.15	And Samuel arose, and gate him vp from Gilgal, vnto Gibeah of Beniamin, and
b.1SA.13.16	And Saul and Ionathan his sonne, and the people that were present with them,
b.1SA.13.17	And the spoilers came out of the campe of the Philistines, in three
b.1SA.13.18	And another company turned the way to Bethoron: and another companie turned
b.1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith found thorowout all the land of Israel: for the
b.1SA.13.2	Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel: whereof two thousand were with
b.1SA.13.20	But all the Israelites went downe to the Philistines, to sharpen euery man
b.1SA.13.21	Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the
b.1SA.13.22	So it came to passe in the day of battell, that there was neither sword nor

b.1SA.13.3	And Ionathan smote the garison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the
b.1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard say, that Saul had smitten a garison of the Philistines,
b.1SA.13.5	And the Philistines gathered themselues together, to fight with Israel,
b.1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait: (for the people were
b.1SA.13.7	And some of the Hebrewes went ouer Iordane, to the land of Gad and Gilead; as
b.1SA.13.8	And he taried seuen dayes, according to the set time that Samuel had
b.1SA.13.9	And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offring to me, and peace offrings. And he
b.1SA.1.4	And when the time was, that Elkanah offered, he gaue to Peninnah his wife, and
b.1SA.14.1	Now it came to passe vpon a day, that Ionathan the sonne of Saul said vnto the
b.1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, Come vp vnto vs: then we will goe vp; for the Lord hath
b.1SA.14.11	And both of them discouered themselues vnto the garison of the Philistines:
b.1SA.14.12	And the men of the garison answered Ionathan and his armour bearer, and said,
b.1SA.14.13	And Ionathan climed vp vpon his hands, and vpon his feete, and his armour
b.1SA.14.14	And that first slaughter which Ionathan and his armour-bearer made, was about
b.1SA.14.15	And there was trembling in the hoste, in the field, and among all the people:
b.1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Beniamin looked: and behold, the
b.1SA.14.17	Then said Saul vnto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is
b.1SA.14.18	And Saul said vnto Ahiah, Bring hither the Arke of God: (for the Arke of God
b.1SA.14.19	And it came to passe while Saul talked vnto the Priest, that the noise that
b.1SA.14.2	And Saul taried in the vttermost part of Gibeah, vnder a Pomegranate tree,
b.1SA.14.20	And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselues, and they
b.1SA.14.21	Moreouer, the Hebrewes that were with the Philistines before that time, which
b.1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel, which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim,
b.1SA.14.23	So the Lord saued Israel that day: and the battell passed ouer vnto Beth-auen.
b.1SA.14.24	And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adiured the
b.1SA.14.25	And all they of the land came to a wood, and there was honie vpon the ground.
b.1SA.14.26	And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honie dropped, but
b.1SA.14.27	But Ionathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath;
b.1SA.14.28	Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the
b.1SA.14.29	Then said Ionathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how
b.1SA.14.3	And Ahiah the sonne of Ahitub, Ichabods brother, the sonne of Phinehas, the
b.1SA.14.30	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoile of

b.1SA.14.32	And the people flewe vpon the spoile, and tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues,
b.1SA.14.33	Then they tolde Saul, saying, Behold, the people sinne against the Lord, in
b.1SA.14.34	And Saul said, Disperse your selues among the people, and say vnto them,
b.1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar vnto the Lord: the same was the first altar that he
b.1SA.14.36	And Saul saide, Let vs goe downe after the Philistines by night, and spoile
b.1SA.14.37	And Saul asked counsell of God, Shall I goe downe after the Philistines? Wilt
b.1SA.14.38	And Saul said, Draw yee neere hither all the chiefe of the people: and know
b.1SA.14.39	For as the Lord liueth, which saueth Israel, though it bee in Ionathan my

b.1SA.14.40	Then said he vnto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I, and Ionathan my sonne
b.1SA.14.41	Therefore Saul saide vnto the Lord God of Israel, Giue a perfect lot. And
b.1SA.14.42	And Saul said, Cast lots betweene me and Ionathan my sonne. And Ionathan was
b.1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Ionathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Ionathan tolde
b.1SA.14.44	And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die,
b.1SA.14.45	And the people said vnto Saul, Shall Ionathan die, who hath wrought this
b.1SA.14.46	Then Saul went vp from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to
b.1SA.14.47	So Saul tooke the kingdom ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on
b.1SA.14.48	And he gathered an hoste, and smote the Amalekites, and deliuered Israel out
b.1SA.14.49	Now the sonnes of Saul, were Ionathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the
b.1SA.14.5	The forefront of the one was situate Northward ouer against Michmash, and the
b.1SA.14.50	And the name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name
b.1SA.14.51	And Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the sonne of
b.1SA.14.52	And there was sore warre against the Philistines, all the dayes of Saul: and
b.1SA.14.6	And Ionathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let vs goe
b.1SA.14.7	And his armour bearer sayd vnto him, Doe all that is in thine heart: turne
b.1SA.14.8	Then said Ionathan, Behold, we will passe ouer vnto these men, and we will

b.1SA.1.5	But vnto Hannah he gaue a worthy portion: (for he loued Hannah, but the Lord
b.1SA.15.1	Samuel also saide vnto Saul, The Lord sent me to annoint thee to bee king ouer
b.1SA.15.10	Then came the word of the Lord vnto Samuel, saying;
b.1SA.15.11	It repenteth me that I haue set vp Saul to be king: for hee is turned backe
b.1SA.15.12	And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was tolde Samuel,
b.1SA.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said vnto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord:
b.1SA.15.14	And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheepe in mine eares,
b.1SA.15.15	And Saul sayde, They haue brought them from the Amalekites: for the people
b.1SA.15.16	Then Samuel sayd vnto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath
b.1SA.15.17	And Samuel said, When thou wast litle in thine owne sight, wast thou not made
b.1SA.15.18	And the Lord sent thee on a iourney, and said, Goe, and vtterly destroy the
b.1SA.15.19	Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst flie vpon
b.1SA.15.2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how

b.1SA.15.21	But the people tooke of the spoile, sheepe and oxen, the chiefe of the things
b.1SA.15.22	And Samuel saide, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and
b.1SA.15.23	For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubburnnesse is as iniquitie
b.1SA.15.24	And Saul said vnto Samuel, I haue sinned: for I haue transgressed the
b.1SA.15.25	Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sinne, and turne againe with me, that I
b.1SA.15.26	And Samuel said vnto Saul, I will not returne with thee: for thou hast

b.1SA.15.28	And Samuel said vnto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdome of Israel from thee
b.1SA.15.29	And also the strength of Israel will not lie, nor repent: for he is not a man
b.1SA.15.3	Now goe, and smite Amalek, and vtterly destroy all that they haue, and spare
b.1SA.15.30	Then he said, I haue sinned; yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the
b.1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned againe after Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.
b.1SA.15.32	Then said Samuel, Bring you hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites: and
b.1SA.15.33	And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childlesse, so shall thy mother
b.1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went vp to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
b.1SA.15.35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul vntill the day of his death:
b.1SA.15.4	And Saul gathered the people together, and numbred them in Telaim, two hundred
b.1SA.15.5	And Saul came to a citie of Amalek, and laid waite in the valley.
b.1SA.15.6	And Saul saide vnto the Kenites, Goe, depart, get you downe from among the
b.1SA.15.7	And Saul smote the Amalekites from Hauilah, vntill thou commest to Shur, that
b.1SA.15.8	And hee tooke Agag the king of the Amalekites aliue, and vtterly destroyed all
b.1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheepe, and of the
b.1SA.1.6	And her aduersary also prouoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the
b.1SA.16.1	And the Lord said vnto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourne for Saul, seeing I
b.1SA.16.10	Againe Iesse made seuen of his sonnes to passe before Samuel; and Samuel said
b.1SA.16.11	And Samuel saide vnto Iesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There
b.1SA.16.12	And he sent, and brought him in: now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautifull
b.1SA.16.13	Then Samuel tooke the horne of oile, and annointed him in the midst of his
b.1SA.16.14	But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an euil spirit from the
b.1SA.16.15	And Sauls seruants said vnto him, Behold now, an euill spirit from God
b.1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command thy seruants which are before thee, to seeke out a
b.1SA.16.17	And Saul said vnto his seruants, Prouide mee now a man, that can play well,
b.1SA.16.18	Then answered one of the seruants, and said, Behold, I haue seene a sonne of
b.1SA.16.19	Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Iesse, and said, Send me Dauid thy sonne,
b.1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, How can I goe? if Saul heare it, he will kill mee. And the
b.1SA.16.20	And Iesse tooke an asse laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid,
b.1SA.16.21	And Dauid came to Saul, and stood before him: and hee loued him greatly, and
b.1SA.16.22	And Saul sent to Iesse, saying, Let Dauid, I pray thee, stand before me: for
b.1SA.16.23	And it came to passe, when the euill spirit from God was vpon Saul, that
b.1SA.16.3	And call Iesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt doe: and
b.1SA.16.4	And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem: and the
b.1SA.16.5	And hee said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice vnto the Lord: sanctifie your
b.1SA.16.6	And it came to passe when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said,
b.1SA.16.7	But the Lord said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, or on the height
b.1SA.16.8	Then Iesse called Abinadab, and made him passe before Samuel: and he said,
b.1SA.16.9	Then Iesse made Shammah to passe by: and he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen
b.1SA.1.7	And as he did so yeere by yeere, when she went vp to the house of the Lord, so
b.1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battell, and were
b.1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, I defie the armies of Israel this day; giue me a
b.1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were
b.1SA.17.12	Now Dauid was the sonne of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Iudah, whose name was
b.1SA.17.13	And the three eldest sonnes of Iesse went, and followed Saul to the battell:
b.1SA.17.14	And Dauid was the yongest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
b.1SA.17.15	But Dauid went, and returned from Saul, to feed his fathers sheepe at
b.1SA.17.16	And the Philistine drewe neere, morning and euening, and presented himselfe
b.1SA.17.17	And Iesse said vnto Dauid his sonne, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of
b.1SA.17.18	And carie these ten cheeses vnto the Captaine of their thousand, and looke
b.1SA.17.19	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah,
b.1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the
b.1SA.17.20	And Dauid rose vp earely in the morning, and left the sheepe with a keeper,
b.1SA.17.21	For Israel and the Philistines had put the battel in aray, army against armie.
b.1SA.17.22	And Dauid left his cariage in the hand of the keeper of the cariage, and
b.1SA.17.23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came vp the champion (the
b.1SA.17.24	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were
b.1SA.17.25	And the men of Israel said, Haue yee seene this man that is come vp? Surely
b.1SA.17.26	And Dauid spake to the men that stood by him, saying; What shall bee done to
b.1SA.17.27	And the people answered him after this maner, saying, So shall it be done to
b.1SA.17.28	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and Eliabs
b.1SA.17.29	And Dauid saide, What haue I now done? Is there not a cause?
b.1SA.17.3	And the Philistines stood on a mountaine on the one side, and Israel stood on
b.1SA.17.30	And hee turned from him towards another, and spake after the same maner: and
b.1SA.17.31	And when the words were heard which Dauid spake, they rehearsed them before
b.1SA.17.32	And Dauid said to Saul, Let no mans heart faile, because of him: thy seruant
b.1SA.17.33	And Saul said to Dauid, Thou art not able to goe against this Philistine, to
b.1SA.17.34	And Dauid said vnto Saul, Thy seruant kept his fathers sheepe, and there came
b.1SA.17.35	And I went out after him, and smote him, and deliuered it out of his mouth:
b.1SA.17.36	Thy seruant slew both the Lyon and the Beare: and this vncircumcised
b.1SA.17.37	Dauid saide moreouer, The Lord that deliuered me out of the paw of the Lyon,
b.1SA.17.38	And Saul armed Dauid with his armour, and hee put an helmet of brasse vpon
b.1SA.17.39	And Dauid girded his sword vpon his armour, and he assayed to goe, for he had
b.1SA.17.4	And there went out a champion out of the campe of the Philistines, named
b.1SA.17.40	And hee tooke his staffe in his hand, and chose him fiue smoothe stones out
b.1SA.17.41	And the Philistine came on and drew neere vnto Dauid, and the man that bare
b.1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw Dauid, hee disdained him: for
b.1SA.17.43	And the Philistine said vnto Dauid, Am I a dog, that thou commest to me with
b.1SA.17.44	And the Philistine said to Dauid, Come to me, and I will giue thy flesh vnto
b.1SA.17.45	Then said Dauid to the Philistine, Thou commest to mee with a sword, and with
b.1SA.17.46	This day wil the Lord deliuer thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee, and
b.1SA.17.47	And all this assembly shal know that the Lord saueth not with sword &amp;
b.1SA.17.48	And it came to passe when the Philistine arose, and came, and drewe nigh to
b.1SA.17.49	And Dauid put his hande in his bag, and tooke thence a stone, and slang it,
b.1SA.17.5	And he had an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and he was armed with a coate of
b.1SA.17.50	So Dauid preuailed ouer the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and
b.1SA.17.51	Therefore Dauid ran and stood vpon the Philistine, and tooke his sword, and
b.1SA.17.52	And the men of Israel, and of Iudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the
b.1SA.17.53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and
b.1SA.17.54	And Dauid tooke the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Ierusalem, but
b.1SA.17.55	And when Saul sawe Dauid goe forth against the Philistine, he sayd vnto Abner
b.1SA.17.56	And the king said, Enquire thou whose sonne the stripling is.
b.1SA.17.57	And as Dauid returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner tooke him,
b.1SA.17.58	And Saul saide to him, Whose sonne art thou, thou yong man? And Dauid
b.1SA.17.6	And he had greaues of brasse vpon his legs, and a target of brasse betweene
b.1SA.17.7	And the staffe of his speare was like a weauers beame, and his speares head
b.1SA.17.8	And hee stood and cried vnto the armies of Israel, and said vnto them, Why are
b.1SA.17.9	If he be able to fight with mee, and to kill me, then will we be your seruants:
b.1SA.1.8	Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest
b.1SA.18.1	And it came to passe when hee made an ende of speaking vnto Saul, that the
b.1SA.18.10	And it came to passe on the morrow, that the euill spirit from God came vpon
b.1SA.18.11	And Saul cast the iauelin; for hee said, I will smite Dauid euen to the wall
b.1SA.18.12	And Saul was afraid of Dauid, because the Lord was with him, and was departed
b.1SA.18.13	Therefore Saul remooued him from him, and made him his captaine ouer a
b.1SA.18.14	And Dauid behaued himselfe wisely in all his wayes; &amp; the Lord was with
b.1SA.18.15	Wherefore when Saul saw that hee behaued himselfe very wisely, hee was afraid
b.1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid, because hee went out and came in before
b.1SA.18.17	And Saul said to Dauid, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I giue thee
b.1SA.18.18	And Dauid said vnto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my fathers family
b.1SA.18.19	But it came to passe at the time when Merab Sauls daughter should haue beene
b.1SA.18.2	And Saul tooke him that day, and would let him go no more home to his fathers
b.1SA.18.20	And Michal Sauls daughter loued Dauid: and they tolde Saul, and the thing
b.1SA.18.21	And Saul said, I will giue him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that
b.1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his seruants, saying, Commune with Dauid secretly, and
b.1SA.18.23	And Sauls seruants spake those wordes in the eares of Dauid: And Dauid said,
b.1SA.18.24	And the seruants of Saul tolde him, saying; On this manner spake Dauid.
b.1SA.18.25	And Saul said, Thus shall yee say to Dauid, The King desireth not any dowrie,
b.1SA.18.26	And when his seruants told Dauid these wordes, it pleased Dauid well to be
b.1SA.18.27	Wherefore Dauid arose, hee and his men, and slew of the Philistines two
b.1SA.18.28	And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with Dauid, and that Michal Sauls
b.1SA.18.29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of Dauid; and Saul became Dauids enemie
b.1SA.18.3	Then Ionathan and Dauid made a couenant, because he loued him as his owne
b.1SA.18.30	Then the Princes of the Philistines went foorth: and it came to passe after
b.1SA.18.4	And Ionathan stript himselfe of the robe that was vpon him, and gaue it to
b.1SA.18.5	And Dauid went out, whither soeuer Saul sent him, and behaued himselfe wisely:
b.1SA.18.6	And it came to passe as they came when Dauid was returned from the slaughter
b.1SA.18.7	And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slaine
b.1SA.18.8	And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him, and he sayd, They haue
b.1SA.18.9	And Saul eyed Dauid from that day, and forward.
b.1SA.1.9	So Hannah rose vp after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunke;
b.1SA.19.1	And Saul spake to Ionathan his sonne, and to all his seruants, that they
b.1SA.19.10	And Saul sought to smite Dauid euen to the wall with the iauelin: but hee
b.1SA.19.11	Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house, to watch him, and to slay him in
b.1SA.19.12	So Michal let Dauid downe thorow a window: and hee went and fled, and
b.1SA.19.13	And Michal tooke an image, and laid it in the bedde, and put a pillow of
b.1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take Dauid, she said, He is sicke.
b.1SA.19.15	And Saul sent the messengers againe to see Dauid, saying, Bring him vp to me
b.1SA.19.16	And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed,
b.1SA.19.17	And Saul said vnto Michal, Why hast thou deceiued me so, and sent away mine
b.1SA.19.18	So Dauid fledde, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all
b.1SA.19.19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, Dauid is at Naioth in Ramah.
b.1SA.19.2	But Ionathan Sauls sonne delighted much in Dauid, and Ionathan told Dauid,
b.1SA.19.20	And Saul sent messengers to take Dauid: and when they sawe the company of the
b.1SA.19.21	And when it was tolde Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophecied
b.1SA.19.22	Then went hee also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and
b.1SA.19.23	And hee went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was vpon him
b.1SA.19.24	And he stript off his clothes also, and prophecied before Samuel in like
b.1SA.19.3	And I will goe out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and
b.1SA.19.4	And Ionathan spake good of Dauid vnto Saul his father, and said vnto him, Let
b.1SA.19.5	For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, &amp; the Lord
b.1SA.19.6	And Saul hearkened vnto the voyce of Ionathan; and Saul sware, As the Lord
b.1SA.19.7	And Ionathan called Dauid, and Ionathan shewed him all those things: and
b.1SA.19.8	And there was warre againe, and Dauid went out, and fought with the
b.1SA.19.9	And the euill spirit from the Lord was vpon Saul, as he sate in his house with
b.1SA.20.1	And Dauid fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Ionathan, What
b.1SA.20.10	Then said Dauid to Ionathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answere
b.1SA.20.11	And Ionathan said vnto Dauid, Come, and let vs goe out into the field. And
b.1SA.20.12	And Ionathan said vnto Dauid, O Lord God of Israel, when I haue sounded my
b.1SA.20.13	The Lord doe so and much more to Ionathan: but if it please my father to doe
b.1SA.20.14	And thou shalt not onely while yet I liue, shew me the kindnesse of the Lord,
b.1SA.20.15	But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindnesse from my house for euer: no not
b.1SA.20.16	So Ionathan made a couenant with the house of Dauid, saying, Let the Lord
b.1SA.20.17	And Ionathan caused Dauid to sweare againe, because he loued him: for he
b.1SA.20.18	Then Ionathan said to Dauid, To morrow is the newe moone: and thou shalt be
b.1SA.20.19	And when thou hast stayed three dayes, then thou shalt goe downe quickly, and
b.1SA.20.2	And he said vnto him, God forbid, thou shalt not die; beholde, my father will
b.1SA.20.20	And I will shoot three arrowes on the side thereof, as though I shot at a
b.1SA.20.21	And behold, I will send a ladde, saying, Goe, find out the arrowes. If I
b.1SA.20.22	But if I say thus vnto the yong man, Behold, the arrowes are beyond thee: goe
b.1SA.20.23	And as touching the matter which thou and I haue spoken of, behold, the Lord
b.1SA.20.24	So Dauid hid himselfe in the field: and when the newe moone was come, the
b.1SA.20.25	And the king sate vpon his seate, as at other times, euen vpon a seate by the
b.1SA.20.26	Neuerthelesse, Saul spake not any thing that day: for hee thought, Some thing
b.1SA.20.27	And it came to passe on the morrow which was the second day of the moneth,
b.1SA.20.28	And Ionathan answered Saul, Dauid earnestly asked leaue of me, to goe to
b.1SA.20.29	And he said, Let me goe, I pray thee, for our familie hath a sacrifice in the
b.1SA.20.3	And Dauid sware moreouer, and said, Thy father certeinly knoweth that I haue
b.1SA.20.30	Then Sauls anger was kindled against Ionathan, and hee said vnto him, Thou
b.1SA.20.31	For as long as the sonne of Iesse liueth vpon the ground, thou shalt not be
b.1SA.20.32	And Ionathan answered Saul his father, and said vnto him, Wherefore shall hee
b.1SA.20.33	And Saul cast a iauelin at him to smite him, whereby Ionathan knewe that it
b.1SA.20.34	So Ionathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eate no meat the
b.1SA.20.35	And it came to passe in the morning, that Ionathan went out into the field,
b.1SA.20.36	And he said vnto his lad, Runne, finde out now the arrowes which I shoote.
b.1SA.20.37	And when the ladde was come to the place of the arrow, which Ionathan had
b.1SA.20.38	And Ionathan cryed after the ladde, Make speed, haste, stay not. And
b.1SA.20.39	But the lad knew not any thing: onely Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter.
b.1SA.20.4	Then said Ionathan vnto Dauid, Whatsoeuer thy soule desireth, I will euen doe
b.1SA.20.40	And Ionathan gaue his artillery vnto his ladde, and said vnto him, Goe, cary
b.1SA.20.41	And assoone as the ladde was gone, Dauid arose out of a place toward the
b.1SA.20.42	And Ionathan said to Dauid, Goe in peace, forasmuch as wee haue sworne both
b.1SA.20.5	And Dauid said vnto Ionathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moone, and I should
b.1SA.20.6	If thy father at all misse me, then say, Dauid earnestly asked leaue of me
b.1SA.20.7	If he say thus, It is well, thy seruant shall haue peace: but if he be very
b.1SA.20.8	Therefore thou shalt deale kindly with thy seruant, for thou hast brought thy
b.1SA.20.9	And Ionathan said, Farre be it from thee: for if I knew certainely that euill
b.1SA.2.1	And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart reioyceth in the Lord, mine horne is
b.1SA.2.10	The aduersaries of the Lord shalbe broken to pieces: out of heauen shal he
b.1SA.2.11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, and the child did minister vnto the
b.1SA.21.1	Then came Dauid to Nob, to Ahimelech the Priest, and Ahimelech was afraide at
b.1SA.21.10	And Dauid arose, and fled that day, for feare of Saul, and went to Achish,
b.1SA.21.11	And the seruants of Achish sayd vnto him, Is not this Dauid the king of the
b.1SA.21.12	And Dauid layd vp these wordes in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish
b.1SA.21.13	And he changed his behauiour before them, and fained himselfe mad in their
b.1SA.21.14	Then saide Achish vnto his seruants, Loe, you see the man is mad: wherefore
b.1SA.21.15	Haue I need of mad-men, that ye haue brought this fellow to play the mad-man
b.1SA.2.12	Now the sonnes of Eli were sonnes of Belial, they knewe not the Lord.
b.1SA.21.2	And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech the Priest, The king hath commanded me a
b.1SA.2.13	And the priests custome with the people was, that when any man offred
b.1SA.21.3	Now therefore what is vnder thine hand? giue me fiue loaues of bread in mine
b.1SA.2.14	And he strooke it into the panne, or kettle, or caldron, or pot: all that the
b.1SA.21.4	And the Priest answered Dauid, and said, There is no common bread vnder mine
b.1SA.2.15	Also before they burnt the fat, the priests seruant came, &amp; said to the
b.1SA.21.5	And Dauid answered the Priest, and said vnto him, Of a trueth women haue beene
b.1SA.2.16	And if any man said vnto him, Let them not faile to burne the fat presently,
b.1SA.21.6	So the Priest gaue him hallowed bread; for there was no bread there, but the
b.1SA.2.17	Wherefore the sinne of the yong men was very great before the Lord: for men
b.1SA.21.7	Now a certaine man of the seruants of Saul was there that day, detained before
b.1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministred before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linnen
b.1SA.21.8	And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech, And is there not here vnder thine hand speare
b.1SA.2.19	Moreouer, his mother made him a litle coate, and brought it to him from yeere
b.1SA.21.9	And the Priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whome thou slewest
b.1SA.2.2	There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is
b.1SA.2.20	And Eli blessed Elkanah, and his wife, and said, The Lord giue thee seed of
b.1SA.2.21	And the Lord visited Hannah, so that shee conceiued, and bare three sonnes,
b.1SA.22.1	Dauid therefore departed thence, and escaped to the caue Adullam: and when his
b.1SA.22.10	And hee enquired of the Lord for him, and gaue him victuals, and gaue him the
b.1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the Priest, the sonne of Ahitub, and all
b.1SA.22.12	And Saul said, Heare now thou sonne of Ahitub: and hee answered, Here I am,
b.1SA.22.13	And Saul saide vnto him, Why haue ye conspired against me, thou and the sonne
b.1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithfull among all
b.1SA.22.15	Did I then beginne to enquire of God for him? be it farre from mee: let not
b.1SA.22.16	And the king saide, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy
b.1SA.22.17	And the king said vnto the footmen that stood about him, Turne and slay the
b.1SA.22.18	And the king said to Doeg, Turne thou and fall vpon the Priests. And Doeg the
b.1SA.22.19	And Nob the citie of the Priests smote he with the edge of the sword, both
b.1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very olde, and heard all that his sonnes did vnto all Israel, and
b.1SA.22.2	And euery one that was in distresse, and euery one that was in debt, and euery
b.1SA.22.20	And one of the sonnes of Ahimelech, the sonne of Ahitub, named Abiathar,
b.1SA.22.21	And Abiathar shewed Dauid that Saul had slaine the Lords Priests.
b.1SA.22.22	And Dauid said vnto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was
b.1SA.22.23	Abide thou with me, feare not: for he that seeketh my life, seeketh thy life:
b.1SA.2.23	And he said vnto them, Why doe ye such things? for I heare of your euil
b.1SA.22.3	And Dauid went thence to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said vnto the king of Moab,
b.1SA.2.24	Nay my sonnes: for it is no good report that I heare; yee make the Lords
b.1SA.22.4	And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the
b.1SA.2.25	If one man sinne against another, the Iudge shall iudge him: but if a man
b.1SA.22.5	And the Prophet Gad said vnto Dauid, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get
b.1SA.2.26	(And the child Samuel grew on, and was in fauour, both with the Lord, and
b.1SA.22.6	When Saul heard that Dauid was discouered, and the men that were with him:
b.1SA.2.27	And there came a man of God vnto Eli, and saide vnto him, Thus saith the
b.1SA.22.7	Then Saul saide vnto his seruants that stood about him, Heare now, ye
b.1SA.2.28	And did I chuse him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my Priest, to
b.1SA.22.8	That all of you haue conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth mee,
b.1SA.2.29	Wherefore kicke ye at my sacrifice, and at mine offering, which I haue
b.1SA.22.9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, (which was set ouer the seruants of Saul) and
b.1SA.2.3	Talke no more so exceeding proudly, let not arrogancie come out of your mouth:
b.1SA.2.30	Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I sayd indeede that thy house, &amp;
b.1SA.2.31	Behold, the dayes come, that I will cut off thine arme, and the arme of thy

b.1SA.23.10	Then saide Dauid, O Lord God of Israel, thy seruant hath certainly heard that
b.1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hande? will Saul come downe, as
b.1SA.23.12	Then said Dauid, Will the men of Keilah deliuer me, and my men, into the hand
b.1SA.23.13	Then Dauid and his men, which were about sixe hundred, arose, and departed
b.1SA.23.14	And Dauid abode in the wildernesse in strong holds, and remained in a
b.1SA.23.15	And Dauid saw that Saul was come out to seeke his life: and Dauid was in the
b.1SA.23.16	And Ionathan Sauls sonne arose, &amp; went to Dauid into the wood, and
b.1SA.23.17	And he said vnto him, Feare not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not
b.1SA.23.18	And they two made a couenant before the Lord: and Dauid abode in the wood,
b.1SA.23.19	Then came vp the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not Dauid hide
b.1SA.2.32	And thou shalt see an enemie in my habitation, in all the wealth which God
b.1SA.23.2	Therefore Dauid enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these
b.1SA.23.20	Now therefore, O king, come downe according to all the desire of thy soule to
b.1SA.23.21	And Saul said, Blessed be yee of the Lord, for yee haue compassion on me.
b.1SA.23.22	Goe, I pray you, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his haunt is,
b.1SA.23.23	See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth
b.1SA.23.24	And they arose, &amp; went to Ziph before Saul: but Dauid and his men were in
b.1SA.23.25	Saul also and his men went to seeke him, and they told Dauid: wherefore he
b.1SA.23.26	And Saul went on this side of the mountaine, and Dauid and his men on that
b.1SA.23.27	But there came a messenger vnto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come: for the
b.1SA.23.28	Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after Dauid, &amp; went against the
b.1SA.23.29	And Dauid went vp from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
b.1SA.2.33	And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine Altar, shall be to
b.1SA.23.3	And Dauids men said vnto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Iudah: how much
b.1SA.2.34	And this shall bee a signe vnto thee, that shall come vpon thy two sonnes, on
b.1SA.23.4	Then Dauid enquired of the Lord yet againe: And the Lord answered him, and
b.1SA.2.35	And I will raise me vp a faithfull Priest, that shall doe according to that
b.1SA.23.5	So Dauid and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistins, and
b.1SA.2.36	And it shall come to passe, that euery one that is left in thine house, shal
b.1SA.23.6	And it came to passe when Abiathar the sonne of Ahimelech fled to Dauid to
b.1SA.23.7	And it was told Saul that Dauid was come to Keilah: and Saul said, God hath
b.1SA.23.8	And Saul called all the people together to warre, to goe downe to Keilah, to
b.1SA.23.9	And Dauid knewe that Saul secretly practised mischiefe against him, and hee
b.1SA.2.4	The vowes of the mightie men are broken, and they that stumbled are girt with
b.1SA.24.1	And it came to passe when Saul was returned from folowing the Philistines,
b.1SA.24.10	Behold, this day thine eyes haue seene, how that the Lord had deliuered thee
b.1SA.24.11	Moreouer my father, See, yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in
b.1SA.24.12	The Lord iudge betweene me and thee, and the Lord auenge me of thee: but mine
b.1SA.24.13	As saith the prouerbe of the ancients, Wickednesse proceedeth from the
b.1SA.24.14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom doest thou pursue?
b.1SA.24.15	The Lord therfore be Iudge, and iudge betweene me and thee, and see, and
b.1SA.24.16	And it came to passe when Dauid had made an ende of speaking these words vnto
b.1SA.24.17	And he said to Dauid, Thou art more righteous then I: for thou hast rewarded
b.1SA.24.18	And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me:
b.1SA.24.19	For if a man finde his enemie, will hee let him goe well away? wherefore the
b.1SA.24.2	Then Saul tooke three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to secke
b.1SA.24.20	And now behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be King, and that the
b.1SA.24.21	Sweare now therefore vnto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seede
b.1SA.24.22	And Dauid sware vnto Saul, and Saul went home: but Dauid and his men gate
b.1SA.24.3	And hee came to the sheepe coates by the way, where was a caue, and Saul went
b.1SA.24.4	And the men of Dauid sayd vnto him, Beholde the day of which the Lord sayd
b.1SA.24.5	And it came to passe afterward, that Dauids heart smote him, because he had
b.1SA.24.6	And hee sayd vnto his men, The Lord forbid that I should doe this thing vnto
b.1SA.24.7	So Dauid stayed his seruants with these wordes, and suffered them not to rise
b.1SA.24.8	Dauid also rose afterward, and went out of the caue, and cryed after Saul,
b.1SA.24.9	And Dauid said to Saul, Wherfore hearest thou mens words, saying, Behold,
b.1SA.2.5	They that were full, haue hired out themselues for bread: and they that were
b.1SA.25.1	And Samuel died, and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented
b.1SA.25.10	And Nabal answered Dauids seruants, and said, Who is Dauid? and who is the
b.1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread and my water, and my flesh that I haue killed for
b.1SA.25.12	So Dauids yong men turned their way, and went againe, and came and told him
b.1SA.25.13	And Dauid said vnto his men, Gird you on euery man his sword. And they girded
b.1SA.25.14	But one of the yong men told Abigail Nabals wife, saying, Behold, Dauid sent
b.1SA.25.15	But the men were very good vnto vs, and we were not hurt, neither missed we
b.1SA.25.16	They were a wall vnto vs both by night and day, all the while we were with
b.1SA.25.17	Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt doe: for euill is determined
b.1SA.25.18	Then Abigail made haste, and tooke two hundred loaues, and two bottles of
b.1SA.25.19	And she said vnto her seruants, Goe on before me, behold, I come after you:
b.1SA.25.2	And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel, and the man was
b.1SA.25.20	And it was so as she rode on the asse, that she came downe by the couert of
b.1SA.25.21	(Now Dauid had said, Surely in vaine haue I kept all that this fellow hath in
b.1SA.25.22	So and more also doe God vnto the enemies of Dauid, if I leaue of all that
b.1SA.25.23	And when Abigail saw Dauid, she hasted, and lighted off the asse, and fell
b.1SA.25.24	And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, vpon me let this iniquitie
b.1SA.25.25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, euen Nabal: for as
b.1SA.25.26	Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, seeing
b.1SA.25.27	And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought vnto my lord, let it
b.1SA.25.28	I pray thee, forgiue the trespasse of thine handmaide: for the Lord will
b.1SA.25.29	Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seeke thy soule: but the soule of
b.1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife, Abigail: and shee
b.1SA.25.30	And it shall come to passe when the Lord shal haue done to my lord, according
b.1SA.25.31	That this shall bee no griefe vnto thee, nor offence of heart vnto my lord,
b.1SA.25.32	And Dauid sayd to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee
b.1SA.25.33	And blessed bee thy aduice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day
b.1SA.25.34	For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liueth, which hath kept mee backe
b.1SA.25.35	So Dauid receiued of her hand that which shee had brought him, and sayd vnto
b.1SA.25.36	And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he held a feast in his house like the
b.1SA.25.37	But it came to passe in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and
b.1SA.25.38	And it came to passe about ten dayes after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that
b.1SA.25.39	And when Dauid heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord, that
b.1SA.25.4	And Dauid heard in the wildernesse, that Nabal did sheare his sheepe.
b.1SA.25.40	And when the seruants of Dauid were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake
b.1SA.25.41	And shee arose, and bowed her selfe on her face to the earth, and sayd,
b.1SA.25.42	And Abigail hasted, and rose, and rode vpon an asse, with fiue damosels of
b.1SA.25.43	Dauid also tooke Ahinoam of Iezreel, and they were also both of them his
b.1SA.25.44	But Saul had giuen Michal his daughter, Dauids wife, to Phalti the sonne of
b.1SA.25.5	And Dauid sent out ten yong men, and Dauid said vnto the young men, Get you vp
b.1SA.25.6	And thus shall ye say to him that liueth in prosperitie, Peace be both to
b.1SA.25.7	And now, I haue heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepheards which were
b.1SA.25.8	Aske thy yong men, and they will shew thee: wherefore let the yong men finde
b.1SA.25.9	And when Dauids yong men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those
b.1SA.2.6	The Lord killeth and maketh aliue, he bringeth downe to the graue, and
b.1SA.26.1	And the Ziphites came vnto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doeth not Dauid hide
b.1SA.26.10	Dauid said furthermore, As the Lord liueth, the Lord shal smite him, or his
b.1SA.26.11	The Lord forbid that I should stretch foorth mine hand against the Lords
b.1SA.26.12	So Dauid tooke the speare and the cruse of water from Sauls bolster, and they
b.1SA.26.13	Then Dauid went ouer to the other side, and stood on the toppe of an hill
b.1SA.26.14	And Dauid cryed to the people, and to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying,
b.1SA.26.15	And Dauid said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee
b.1SA.26.16	This thing is not good that thou hast done: as the Lord liueth, ye are worthy
b.1SA.26.17	And Saul knew Dauids voyce, and said, Is this thy voice, my sonne Dauid? And
b.1SA.26.18	And he said, Wherefore doeth my lord thus pursue after his seruant? for what
b.1SA.26.19	Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king heare the words of his
b.1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose, and went downe to the wildernesse of Ziph, hauing three
b.1SA.26.20	Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the
b.1SA.26.21	Then said Saul, I haue sinned: Returne, my sonne Dauid, for I will no more
b.1SA.26.22	And Dauid answered, and sayd, Behold the kings speare, and let one of the
b.1SA.26.23	The Lord render to euery man his righteousnesse, and his faithfulnesse: for
b.1SA.26.24	And behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes: so let my life
b.1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to Dauid, Blessed be thou, my sonne Dauid: thou shalt both doe
b.1SA.26.3	And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Ieshimon by the way:
b.1SA.26.4	Dauid therefore sent out spies, and vnderstood that Saul was come in very
b.1SA.26.5	And Dauid arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and Dauid
b.1SA.26.6	Then answered Dauid, and sayd to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the
b.1SA.26.7	So Dauid and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay
b.1SA.26.8	Then said Abishai to Dauid, God hath deliuered thine enemie into thine hand
b.1SA.26.9	And Dauid sayd to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand
b.1SA.2.7	The Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth vp.
b.1SA.27.1	And Dauid sayd in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul:
b.1SA.27.10	And Achish said, Whither haue ye made a rode to day? And Dauid said, Against
b.1SA.27.11	And Dauid saued neither man nor woman aliue, to bring tidings to Gath,
b.1SA.27.12	And Achish beleeued Dauid, saying, Hee hath made his people Israel vtterly to
b.1SA.27.2	And Dauid arose, and hee passed ouer with the sixe hundred men that were with
b.1SA.27.3	And Dauid dwelt with Achish at Gath, he, and his men, euery man with his
b.1SA.27.4	And it was told Saul, that Dauid was fled to Gath, and he sought no more
b.1SA.27.5	And Dauid said vnto Achish, If I haue now found grace in thine eyes, let them
b.1SA.27.6	Then Achish gaue him Ziklag that day: wherfore Ziklag pertaineth vnto the
b.1SA.27.7	And the time that Dauid dwelt in the countrey of the Philistines, was a full
b.1SA.27.8	And Dauid and his men went vp and inuaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites,
b.1SA.27.9	And Dauid smote the land, and left neither man nor woman aliue, and tooke away
b.1SA.2.8	He raiseth vp the poore out of the dust, and lifteth vp the begger from the
b.1SA.28.1	And it came to passe in those dayes, that the Philistines gathered their
b.1SA.28.10	And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liueth, there shall no
b.1SA.28.11	Then said the woman, Whome shall I bring vp vnto thee? and he said, Bring me
b.1SA.28.12	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a lowd voyce; and the woman
b.1SA.28.13	And the king sayd vnto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the
b.1SA.28.14	And he said vnto her, What forme is he of? And she said, An old man commeth
b.1SA.28.15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me vp? And
b.1SA.28.16	Then said Samuel, Wherefore then doest thou aske of mee, seeing the Lord is
b.1SA.28.17	And the Lord hath done to him, as hee spake by mee: for the Lord hath rent
b.1SA.28.18	Because thou obeiedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce
b.1SA.28.19	Moreouer, the Lord will also deliuer Israel with thee, into the hand of the
b.1SA.28.2	And Dauid said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy seruant can doe. And
b.1SA.28.20	Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid,
b.1SA.28.21	And the woman came vnto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and sayd
b.1SA.28.22	Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also vnto the voyce of thine
b.1SA.28.23	But hee refused, and said, I will not eate. But his seruants together with
b.1SA.28.24	And the woman had a fat calfe in the house, and she hasted, and killed it,
b.1SA.28.25	And she brought it before Saul, and before his seruants, and they did eate:
b.1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah,
b.1SA.28.4	And the Philistines gathered themselues together, and came and pitched in
b.1SA.28.5	And when Saul saw the hoste of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart
b.1SA.28.6	And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by
b.1SA.28.7	Then said Saul vnto his seruants, Seeke me a woman that hath a familiar
b.1SA.28.8	And Saul disguised himselfe, and put on other raiment, and hee went, and two
b.1SA.28.9	And the woman saide vnto him, Beholde, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how
b.1SA.2.9	He will keepe the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall bee silent in
b.1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the
b.1SA.29.10	Wherfore now rise vp early in the morning, with thy masters seruants that are
b.1SA.29.11	So Dauid and his men rose vp early to depart in the morning, to returne into
b.1SA.29.2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but
b.1SA.29.3	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What doe these Hebrewes here? And
b.1SA.29.4	And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him, and the princes of the
b.1SA.29.5	Is not this Dauid, of whom they sang one to another in daunces, saying, Saul
b.1SA.29.6	Then Achish called Dauid, and said vnto him, Surely, as the Lord liueth, thou
b.1SA.29.7	Wherefore now returne and goe in peace, that thou displease not the lords of
b.1SA.29.8	And Dauid said vnto Achish, But what haue I done? and what hast thou found in
b.1SA.29.9	And Achish answered, and said to Dauid, I know that thou art good in my sight,
b.1SA.30.1	And it came to passe when Dauid and his men were come to Ziklag on the third
b.1SA.30.10	But Dauid pursued, he and foure hundred men: (for two hundred abode behinde,
b.1SA.30.11	And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to Dauid, and gaue
b.1SA.30.12	And they gaue him a piece of a cake of figges, and two clusters of raisins:
b.1SA.30.13	And Dauid sayde vnto him, To whome belongest thou? and whence art thou? And
b.1SA.30.14	Wee made an inuasion vpon the South of the Cherethites, and vpon the coast
b.1SA.30.15	And Dauid sayde to him, Canst thou bring me downe to this company? And he
b.1SA.30.16	And when he had brought him downe, behold, they were spread abroad vpon all
b.1SA.30.17	And Dauid smote them from the twilight, euen vnto the euening of the next
b.1SA.30.18	And Dauid recouered all that the Amalekites had caried away: and Dauid
b.1SA.30.19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither
b.1SA.30.2	And had taken the women captiues, that were therein; they slewe not any either
b.1SA.30.20	And Dauid tooke all the flockes, and the herds, which they draue before those
b.1SA.30.21	And Dauid came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not
b.1SA.30.22	Then answered all the wicked men, and men of Belial, of those that went with
b.1SA.30.23	Then said Dauid, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the Lord
b.1SA.30.24	For who will hearken vnto you in this matter? But as his part is that goeth
b.1SA.30.25	And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute, and an
b.1SA.30.26	And when Dauid came to Ziklag, hee sent of the spoile vnto the Elders of
b.1SA.30.27	To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in South Ramoth, and to
b.1SA.30.28	And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to
b.1SA.30.29	And to them which were in Rachal, and them which were in the cities of the
b.1SA.30.3	So Dauid and his men came to the citie, and beholde, it was burnt with fire,
b.1SA.30.30	And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to
b.1SA.30.31	And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where Dauid himselfe
b.1SA.30.4	Then Dauid and the people that were with him, lift vp their voice, and wept,
b.1SA.30.5	And Dauids two wiues were taken captiues, Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse, and
b.1SA.30.6	And Dauid was greatly distressed: for the people spake of stoning him, because
b.1SA.30.7	And Dauid said to Abiathar the Priest Ahimelechs sonne, I pray thee, bring mee
b.1SA.30.8	And Dauid enquired at the Lord, saying; Shall I pursue after this troupe?
b.1SA.30.9	So Dauid went, hee, and the sixe hundred men that were with him, and came to
b.1SA.3.1	And the child Samuel ministred vnto the Lord before Eli: and the word of the
b.1SA.3.10	And the Lord came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.
b.1SA.3.11	And the Lord sayd to Samuel, Behold, I will doe a thing in Israel, at which,
b.1SA.31.1	Nowe the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from
b.1SA.31.10	And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body
b.1SA.31.11	And when the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead heard of that which the Philistines
b.1SA.31.12	All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and tooke the body of Saul,
b.1SA.31.13	And they tooke their bones, and buried them vnder a tree at Iabesh, and
b.1SA.3.12	In that day, I will performe against Eli, all things which I haue spoken
b.1SA.31.2	And the Philistines followed hard vpon Saul, and vpon his sonnes, and the
b.1SA.3.13	For I haue tolde him, that I will iudge his house for euer, for the iniquitie
b.1SA.31.3	And the battell went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was
b.1SA.3.14	And therefore I haue sworne vnto the house of Eli, that the iniquitie of

b.1SA.3.15	And Samuel lay vntill the morning, and opened the doores of the house of the
b.1SA.31.5	And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise vpon his
b.1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel my sonne. And he answered, Here am
b.1SA.31.6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour bearer, and all his men that
b.1SA.3.17	And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said vnto thee? I pray thee
b.1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they
b.1SA.3.18	And Samuel tolde him euery whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is
b.1SA.31.8	And it came to passe on the morrow when the Philistines came to strip the
b.1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words
b.1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land
b.1SA.3.2	And it came to passe at that time, when Eli was layd downe in his place, and
b.1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan euen to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established
b.1SA.3.21	And the Lord appeared againe in Shiloh: for the Lord reueiled himselfe to
b.1SA.3.3	And yer the lampe of God went out in the Temple of the Lord, where the Arke of

b.1SA.3.5	And he ranne vnto Eli, and sayd, Here am I, for thou calledst me. And he said,
b.1SA.3.6	And the Lord called yet againe, Samuel. And Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and
b.1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet
b.1SA.3.8	And the Lord called Samuel againe the third time. And hee arose, and went to
b.1SA.3.9	Therefore Eli said vnto Samuel, Go, lie downe, &amp; it shal be, if he call
b.1SA.4.1	And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the
b.1SA.4.10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled euery man
b.1SA.4.11	And the Arke of God was taken, and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, and
b.1SA.4.12	And there ran a man of Beniamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same
b.1SA.4.13	And when hee came, loe, Eli sate vpon a seat by the way side, watching: for
b.1SA.4.14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, hee said; What meaneth the noise
b.1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninetie and eight yeeres old, and his eyes were dimme, that he
b.1SA.4.16	And the man said vnto Eli, I am he, that came out of the army, and I fled to
b.1SA.4.17	And the messenger answered, and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines,
b.1SA.4.18	And it came to passe when hee made mention of the Arke of God, that he fell
b.1SA.4.19	And his daughter in law Phinehas wife was with childe neere to be deliuered:
b.1SA.4.2	And the Philistines put themselues in aray against Israel: and when they
b.1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her, said vnto her:
b.1SA.4.21	And she named the childe Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel,
b.1SA.4.22	And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the Arke of God is
b.1SA.4.3	And when the people were come into the campe, the Elders of Israel said,
b.1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the Arke of
b.1SA.4.5	And when the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord came into the campe, all Israel
b.1SA.4.6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth
b.1SA.4.7	And the Philistines were afraid, for they saide, God is come into the campe.
b.1SA.4.8	Woe vnto vs: who shall deliuer vs out of the hand of these mightie Gods? these
b.1SA.4.9	Bee strong, and quit your selues like men, O ye Philistines, that yee be not
b.1SA.5.1	And the Philistines tooke the Arke of God, and brought it from Ebenezer vnto
b.1SA.5.10	Therfore they sent the Arke of God to Ekron: and it came to passe as the Arke
b.1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and
b.1SA.5.12	And the men that died not, were smitten with the Emerods: and the cry of the
b.1SA.5.2	When the Philistines tooke the Arke of God, they brought it into the house of

b.1SA.5.4	And when they arose earely on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen
b.1SA.5.5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagons house,
b.1SA.5.6	But the hand of the Lord was heauy vpon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them,
b.1SA.5.7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The Arke of the God
b.1SA.5.8	They sent therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines vnto them,
b.1SA.5.9	And it was so, that after they had caried it about, the hand of the Lord was
b.1SA.6.1	And the Arke of the Lord was in the countrey of the Philistines seuen moneths.
b.1SA.6.10	And the men did so: and tooke two milch-kine, and tied them to the cart, and
b.1SA.6.11	And they layde the Arke of the Lord vpon the cart, and the coffer, with the
b.1SA.6.12	And the kine tooke the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along
b.1SA.6.13	And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat haruest in the valley: and
b.1SA.6.14	And the cart came into the field of Ioshua a Bethshemite, &amp; stood there,
b.1SA.6.15	And the Leuites tooke downe the Arke of the Lord, and the coffer that was

b.1SA.6.2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diuiners, saying, What
b.1SA.6.20	And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord
b.1SA.6.21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-iearim, saying, The

b.1SA.6.4	Then said they, What shall be the trespasse offering, which wee shall returne
b.1SA.6.5	Wherefore ye shall make images of your Emerodes, and images of your Mice, that
b.1SA.6.6	Wherefore then doe yee harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh

b.1SA.7.1	And the men of Kiriath-iearim came, and fetcht vp the Arke of the Lord, and
b.1SA.7.10	And as Samuel was offering vp the burnt offering, the Philistines drewe neere
b.1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and
b.1SA.7.12	Then Samuel tooke a stone, and set it betweene Mizpeh and Shen, and called
b.1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of
b.1SA.7.14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to
b.1SA.7.15	And Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his life.
b.1SA.7.16	And he went from yeere to yeere in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh,
b.1SA.7.17	And his returne was to Ramah: for there was his house: and there hee iudged
b.1SA.7.2	And it came to passe while the Arke abode in Kiriath-iearim, that the time was
b.1SA.7.3	And Samuel spake vnto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye doe returne vnto
b.1SA.7.4	Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and serued the
b.1SA.7.5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you vnto the
b.1SA.7.6	And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and powred it out before
b.1SA.7.7	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered
b.1SA.7.8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to crie vnto the Lord our
b.1SA.7.9	And Samuel tooke a sucking lambe, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly
b.1SA.8.1	And it came to passe, when Samuel was old, that he made his sonnes Iudges ouer
b.1SA.8.10	And Samuel told all the words of the Lord vnto the people, that asked of him
b.1SA.8.11	And hee sayd, This will be the maner of the king that shall reigne ouer you:
b.1SA.8.12	And hee will appoint him Captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer
b.1SA.8.13	And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cookes, and
b.1SA.8.14	And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliue-yards, euen
b.1SA.8.15	And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and giue to
b.1SA.8.16	And hee will take your men seruants, and your mayd seruants, and your
b.1SA.8.17	Hee will take the tenth of your sheepe, and ye shall be his seruants.
b.1SA.8.18	And ye shall cry out in that day, because of your king which ye shall haue
b.1SA.8.19	Neuerthelesse, the people refused to obey the voyce of Samuel; and they said,
b.1SA.8.2	Now the name of his first borne was Ioel, and the name of his second, Abiah:
b.1SA.8.20	That we also may be like all the nations, and that our King may iudge vs, and
b.1SA.8.21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the
b.1SA.8.22	And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken vnto their voyce, and make them a King.
b.1SA.8.3	And his sonnes walked not in his wayes, but turned aside after lucre, and
b.1SA.8.4	Then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselues together, and came to Samuel
b.1SA.8.5	And said vnto him, Behold, thou art olde, and thy sonnes walke not in thy
b.1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Giue vs a King to iudge vs:
b.1SA.8.7	And the Lord said vnto Samuel, Hearken vnto the voyce of the people in all
b.1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they haue done since the day that I brought
b.1SA.8.9	Nowe therefore hearken vnto their voyce: howbeit, yet protest solemnly vnto
b.1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Beniamin, whose name was Kish, the sonne of Abiel, the
b.1SA.9.10	Then said Saul to his seruant, Wel said, come, let vs go: so they went vnto
b.1SA.9.11	And as they went vp the hill to the city, they found yong maydens going out
b.1SA.9.12	And they answered them, and said, He is: behold, he is before you, make haste
b.1SA.9.13	Assoone as ye be come into the citie, ye shall straightway finde him, before
b.1SA.9.14	And they went vp into the citie: and when they were come into the citie,
b.1SA.9.15	Now the Lord had told Samuel in his eare a day before Saul came, saying,
b.1SA.9.16	To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Beniamin,
b.1SA.9.17	And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said vnto him, Behold the man whom I spake
b.1SA.9.18	Then Saul drew neere to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee,
b.1SA.9.19	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the Seer: Goe vp before me vnto the
b.1SA.9.2	And he had a sonne, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and
b.1SA.9.20	And as for thine asses that were lost three dayes agoe, set not thy minde on
b.1SA.9.21	And Saul answered, and said, Am not I a Beniamite, of the smallest of the
b.1SA.9.22	And Samuel tooke Saul, and his seruant, and brought them into the parlour,
b.1SA.9.23	And Samuel said vnto the cooke, Bring the portion which I gaue thee, of which
b.1SA.9.24	And the cooke took vp the shoulder, and that which was vpon it, and set it
b.1SA.9.25	And when they were come downe from the high place into the citie, Samuel
b.1SA.9.26	And they arose early: and it came to passe about the spring of the day, that
b.1SA.9.27	And as they were going downe to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid
b.1SA.9.3	And the asses of Kish, Sauls father, were lost; and Kish said to Saul his
b.1SA.9.4	And he passed thorow mount Ephraim, and passed thorow the land of Shalisha,
b.1SA.9.5	And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his seruant that was
b.1SA.9.6	And hee said vnto him, Behold now, there is in this citie a man of God, and he
b.1SA.9.7	Then said Saul to his seruaunt, But behold, if we goe, what shall wee bring
b.1SA.9.8	And the seruant answered Saul againe, and said, Behold, I haue here at hand
b.1SA.9.9	(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake; Come,
b.1TH.1.1	Paul and Siluanus, and Timotheus, vnto the Church of the Thessalonians, which is
b.1TH.1.10	And to waite for his sonne from heauen whom he raised from the dead, euen
b.1TH.1.2	We giue thankes to God alwaies for you all, making mention of you in our
b.1TH.1.3	Remembring without ceasing your worke of faith, and labour of loue, and
b.1TH.1.4	Knowing, brethren beloued, your election of God.
b.1TH.1.5	For our Gospel came not vnto you in word onely: but also in power, and in the
b.1TH.1.6	And yee became followers of vs, and of the Lord, hauing receiued the word in
b.1TH.1.7	So that ye were ensamples to all that beleeue in
b.1TH.1.8	For from you sounded out the Word of the Lord, not onely in Macedonia &amp;
b.1TH.1.9	For they themselues shew of vs, what maner of entring in we had vnto you, and
b.1TH.2.1	For your selues, brethren, knowe our entrance in vnto you, that it was not in
b.1TH.2.10	Yee are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and iustly, and vnblameably wee
b.1TH.2.11	As you know, how wee exhorted and comforted, and charged euery one of you,
b.1TH.2.12	That ye would walke worthy of God, who hath called you vnto his kingdome and
b.1TH.2.13	For this cause also thanke wee God without ceasing, because when yee receiued
b.1TH.2.14	For yee, brethren, became followers of the Churches of God, which in Iudea
b.1TH.2.15	Who both killed the Lord Iesus, and their owne Prophets, and haue persecuted
b.1TH.2.16	Forbidding vs to speake to the Gentiles, that they might bee saued, to fill
b.1TH.2.17	But wee, brethren, beeing taken from you for a short time, in presence, not
b.1TH.2.18	Wherefore we would haue come vnto you (euen I Paul) once &amp; againe: but
b.1TH.2.19	For what is our hope, or ioy, or crowne of reioycing? Are not euen ye in the
b.1TH.2.2	But euen after that wee had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as
b.1TH.2.20	For, ye are our glory and ioy.
b.1TH.2.3	For our exhortation was not of deceite, nor of vncleannesse, nor in guile:
b.1TH.2.4	But as we were allowed of God to bee put in trust with the Gospel, euen so wee
b.1TH.2.5	For neither at any time vsed wee flattering wordes, as yee knowe, nor a cloke
b.1TH.2.6	Nor of men sought we glorie, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might
b.1TH.2.7	But wee were gentle among you, euen as a nurse cherisheth her children:
b.1TH.2.8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to haue imparted vnto
b.1TH.2.9	For yee remember, brethren, our labour and trauaile: for labourng night and
b.1TH.3.1	Wherefore when wee could no longer forbeare, wee thought it good to bee left
b.1TH.3.10	Night &amp; day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might
b.1TH.3.11	Now God himselfe and our Father, and our Lord Iesus Christ direct our way
b.1TH.3.12	And the Lorde make you to increase, &amp; abound in loue one towards another,
b.1TH.3.13	To the end hee may stablish your hearts vnblameable in holinesse before God
b.1TH.3.2	And sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God, and our fellow labourer in
b.1TH.3.3	That no man should be mooued by these afflictions: for your selues know that
b.1TH.3.4	For verily when wee were with you, we told you before, that we should suffer
b.1TH.3.5	For this cause when I could no longer forbeare, I sent to know your faith,
b.1TH.3.6	But now when Timotheus came from you vnto vs, and brought vs good tidings of
b.1TH.3.7	Therefore brethren, wee were comforted ouer you in all our affliction and
b.1TH.3.8	For now we liue, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
b.1TH.3.9	For what thankes can we render to God againe for you, for all the ioy
b.1TH.4.1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Iesus,
b.1TH.4.10	And in deed ye doe it towards all the brethren, which are in all Macedonia:
b.1TH.4.11	And that ye studie to be quiet, and to doe your owne businesse, and to worke
b.1TH.4.12	That ye may walke honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may haue
b.1TH.4.13	But I would not haue you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
b.1TH.4.14	For if we beleeue that Iesus died, and rose againe: euen so them also which
b.1TH.4.15	For this we say vnto you by the word of the Lord, That we which are aliue and
b.1TH.4.16	For the Lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with a shout, with the voyce
b.1TH.4.17	Then we which are aliue, and remaine, shalbe caught vp together with them in
b.1TH.4.18	Wherefore, comfort one an other with these words.
b.1TH.4.2	For yee know what commandements wee gaue you, by the Lord Iesus.
b.1TH.4.3	For this is the will of God, euen your sanctification, that yee should
b.1TH.4.4	That euery one of you should know how to possesse his vessell in
b.1TH.4.5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, euen as the Gentiles which know not God:
b.1TH.4.6	That no man goe beyond and defraud his brother in any matter, because that the
b.1TH.4.7	For God hath not called vs vnto vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse.
b.1TH.4.8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also giuen
b.1TH.4.9	But as touching brotherly loue, ye need not that I write vnto you: for yee
b.1TH.5.1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, yee haue no need that I write vnto
b.1TH.5.10	Who died for vs, that whether we wake or sleepe, we should liue together with
b.1TH.5.11	Wherefore, comfort your selues together, and edifie one another, euen as also
b.1TH.5.12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are
b.1TH.5.13	And to esteeme them very highly in loue for their workes sake, and be at
b.1TH.5.14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warne them that are vnruly, comfort the feeble
b.1TH.5.15	See that none render euill for euill vnto any man: but euer follow that which
b.1TH.5.16	Reioyce euermore:
b.1TH.5.17	Pray without ceasing:
b.1TH.5.18	In euery thing giue thankes: for this is the will of God in Christ Iesus
b.1TH.5.19	Quench not the spirit:
b.1TH.5.2	For your selues knowe perfectly that the day of the Lord so commeth as a
b.1TH.5.20	Despise not prophecyings:
b.1TH.5.21	Proue all things: hold fast that which is good.
b.1TH.5.22	Abstaine from all appearance of euill.
b.1TH.5.23	And the very God of peace sanctifie you wholly: and I pray God your whole
b.1TH.5.24	Faithfull is hee that calleth you, who also will doe it.
b.1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for vs.
b.1TH.5.26	Greete all the brethren with an holy kisse.
b.1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord, that this Epistle bee read vnto all the holy
b.1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you, Amen.
b.1TH.5.3	For when they shal say, Peace and safety: then sudden destructio commeth vpon
b.1TH.5.4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkenesse, that that day should ouertake you as
b.1TH.5.5	Yee are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of
b.1TH.5.6	Therefore let vs not sleepe, as doe others: but let vs watch and be sober.
b.1TH.5.7	For they that sleepe, sleepe in the night, and they that bee drunken, are
b.1TH.5.8	But let vs who are of the day, bee sober, putting on the brestplate of faith
b.1TH.5.9	For God hath not appointed vs to wrath: but to obtaine saluation by our Lord
b.1TI.1.1	Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the commaundement of God our Sauiour, &amp;
b.1TI.1.10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselues with mankinde, for
b.1TI.1.11	According to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to
b.1TI.1.12	And I thanke Christ Iesus our Lord, who hath enabled mee: for that he counted
b.1TI.1.13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecuter, and iniurious. But I obtained
b.1TI.1.14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith, &amp; loue,
b.1TI.1.15	This is a faithfull saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Iesus
b.1TI.1.16	Howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Iesus Christ
b.1TI.1.17	Now vnto ye king eternal, immortall, inuisible, the onely wise God, be honour
b.1TI.1.18	This charge I commit vnto thee, sonne Timothie, according to the prophesies
b.1TI.1.19	Holding faith, and a good conscience, which some hauing put away, concerning
b.1TI.1.2	Unto Timothie my own sonne in the Faith: Grace, mercie, and peace from God our
b.1TI.1.20	Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whome I haue deliuered vnto Satan, that
b.1TI.1.3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that
b.1TI.1.4	Neither giue heed to fables, and endlesse genealogies, which minister
b.1TI.1.5	Now the end of the commandement is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good
b.1TI.1.6	From which some hauing swarued, haue turned aside vnto vaine iangling,
b.1TI.1.7	Desiring to bee teachers of the Law, vnderstading neither what they say, nor
b.1TI.1.8	But we know that the Law is good, if a man vse it lawfully.
b.1TI.1.9	Knowing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the
b.1TI.2.1	I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,
b.1TI.2.10	But (which becommeth women professing godlines) with good works.
b.1TI.2.11	Let the woman learne in silence with all subiection:
b.1TI.2.12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but
b.1TI.2.13	For Adam was first formed, then Eue:
b.1TI.2.14	And Adam was not deceiued, but the woman being deceiued was in the
b.1TI.2.15	Notwithstanding she shall be saued in child-bearing, if they continue in
b.1TI.2.2	For Kings, and for all that are in authoritie, that we may leade a quiet and
b.1TI.2.3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sauiour,
b.1TI.2.4	Who will haue all men to bee saued, and to come vnto the knowledge of the
b.1TI.2.5	For there is one God, and one Mediatour betweene God and men, the man Christ
b.1TI.2.6	Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all, to be testified in due time.
b.1TI.2.7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an Apostle (I speake the trueth in
b.1TI.2.8	I will therefore that men pray euery where, lifting vp holy handes without
b.1TI.2.9	In like maner also, that women adorne themselues in modest apparell, with
b.1TI.3.1	This is a true saying: If a man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a
b.1TI.3.10	And let these also first be proued; then let them vse the office of a Deacon,
b.1TI.3.11	Euen so must their wiues be graue; not slanderers, sober, faithfull in all
b.1TI.3.12	Let the Deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children, and their
b.1TI.3.13	For they that haue vsed the office of a Deacon well, purchase to themselues a
b.1TI.3.14	These things write I vnto thee, hoping to come vnto thee shortly.
b.1TI.3.15	But if I tary long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behaue thy
b.1TI.3.16	And without controuersie, great is the mysterie of godlinesse: God was
b.1TI.3.2	A Bishop then must be blamelesse, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of
b.1TI.3.3	Not giuen to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre, but patient, not a
b.1TI.3.4	One that ruleth well his owne house, hauing his children in subiection with
b.1TI.3.5	(For if a man know not how to rule his owne house, how shall he take care of
b.1TI.3.6	Not a nouice, lest being lifted vp with pride, hee fall into the condemnation
b.1TI.3.7	Moreouer, hee must haue a good report of them which are without, lest he fall
b.1TI.3.8	Likewise must the Deacons bee graue, not double tongued, not giuen to much
b.1TI.3.9	Holding the mysterie of the faith in a pure conscience.
b.1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart
b.1TI.4.10	For therfore we both labour, and suffer reproch, because we trust in the
b.1TI.4.11	These things command &amp; teach.
b.1TI.4.12	Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the beleeuers, in
b.1TI.4.13	Till I come, giue attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
b.1TI.4.14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was giuen thee by prophesie, with
b.1TI.4.15	Meditate vpon these things, giue thy selfe wholly to them, that thy profiting
b.1TI.4.16	Take heed vnto thy selfe, and vnto the doctrine: continue in them: for in
b.1TI.4.2	Speaking lies in hypocrisie, hauing their conscience seared with a hote iron,
b.1TI.4.3	Forbidding to marry, and commanding to absteine from meates, which God hath
b.1TI.4.4	For euery creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
b.1TI.4.5	For it is sanctified by the word of God, and prayer.
b.1TI.4.6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good
b.1TI.4.7	But refuse prophane and olde wiues fables, and exercise thy selfe rather vnto
b.1TI.4.8	For bodily exercise profiteth litle, but godlinesse is profitable vnto all
b.1TI.4.9	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation:
b.1TI.5.1	Rebuke not an Elder, but intreate him as a father, and the yonger men as
b.1TI.5.10	Well reported of for good works, if shee haue brought vp children, if shee
b.1TI.5.11	But the yonger widowes refuse: for when they haue begunne to waxe wanton
b.1TI.5.12	Hauing damnation, because they haue cast off their first faith.
b.1TI.5.13	And withall they learne to bee idle, wandering about from house to house; and
b.1TI.5.14	I will therefore that the yonger women marry, beare children, guid the house,
b.1TI.5.15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
b.1TI.5.16	If any man or woman that beleeueth haue widowes, let them relieue them, and
b.1TI.5.17	Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially
b.1TI.5.18	For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not mousell the oxe that treadeth out the
b.1TI.5.19	Against an Elder receiue not an accusation, but before two or three
b.1TI.5.2	The elder women as mothers, the yonger as sisters with all puritie.
b.1TI.5.20	Them that sinne rebuke before all, that others also may feare.
b.1TI.5.21	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, and the elect Angels,
b.1TI.5.22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither bee partaker of other mens sinnes.
b.1TI.5.23	Drinke no longer water, but vse a little wine for thy stomackes sake, and
b.1TI.5.24	Some mens sinnes are open before hand, going before to iudgement: and some

b.2CH.10.2	And it came to passe when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat (who was in Egypt,

b.2CH.13.13	But Ieroboam caused an ambushment to come about behinde them: so they were
b.2CH.13.14	And when Iudah looked backe, behold, the battel was before and behind; and
b.2CH.13.15	Then the men of Iudah gaue a shout: and as the men of Iudah shouted, it came
b.2CH.13.16	And the children of Israel fled before Iudah: and God deliuered them into
b.2CH.13.17	And Abiiah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fel
b.2CH.13.18	Thus the children of Israel were brought vnder at that time, and the children
b.2CH.13.19	And Abiiah pursued after Ieroboam, &amp; tooke cities from him, Beth-el with
b.2CH.13.2	He reigned three yeres in Ierusalem: (his mothers name also was Michaiah the

b.2CH.13.21	But Abiiah waxed mighty, and married fourteene wiues, and begate twentie and
b.2CH.13.22	And the rest of the acts of Abiiah, and his waies, and his sayings, are
b.2CH.13.3	And Abiiah set the battel in aray with an army of valiant men of warre, euen
b.2CH.13.4	And Abiiah stood vp vpon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and sayde,
b.2CH.13.5	Ought you not to know, that the Lord God of Israel gaue the kingdome ouer
b.2CH.13.6	Yet Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, the seruant of Solomon the sonne of Dauid, is
b.2CH.13.7	And there are gathered vnto him vaine men the children of Belial, and haue
b.2CH.13.8	And now ye thinke to withstand the kingdome of the Lord, in the hand of the
b.2CH.13.9	Haue yee not cast out the Priests of the Lord the sonnes of Aaron, and the
b.2CH.1.4	But the Arke of God had Dauid brought vp from Kiriath-iearim, to the place
b.2CH.14.1	So Abiiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the citie of Dauid,
b.2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battel in aray in the valley
b.2CH.14.11	And Asa cried vnto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee
b.2CH.14.12	So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Iudah, and the
b.2CH.14.13	And Asa and the people that were with him, pursued them vnto Gerar: and the
b.2CH.14.14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the feare of the Lord
b.2CH.14.15	They smote also the tents of cattell, and caried away sheepe and camels
b.2CH.14.2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
b.2CH.14.3	For hee tooke away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and
b.2CH.14.4	And commanded Iudah to seeke the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the Law,
b.2CH.14.5	Also he tooke away out of all the cities of Iudah, the high places and the
b.2CH.14.6	And hee built fenced cities in Iudah; for the land had rest, and hee had no
b.2CH.14.7	Therefore hee said vnto Iudah, Let vs build these cities, &amp; make about
b.2CH.14.8	And Asa had an armie of men that bare targets and speares, out of Iudah three
b.2CH.14.9	And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian, with an host of a

b.2CH.15.1	And the Spirit of God came vpon Azariah the sonne of Oded.
b.2CH.15.10	So they gathered themselues together at Ierusalem, in the third moneth, in
b.2CH.15.11	And they offered vnto the Lord the same time, of the spoile which they had
b.2CH.15.12	And they entred into a couenant to seeke the Lord God of their fathers, with
b.2CH.15.13	That whosoeuer would not seeke the Lord God of Israel, should be put to
b.2CH.15.14	And they sware vnto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with
b.2CH.15.15	And all Iudah reioyced at the oath: for they had sworne with all their heart,
b.2CH.15.16	And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he remooued her from
b.2CH.15.17	But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: neuerthelesse the
b.2CH.15.18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had
b.2CH.15.19	And there was no more warre vnto the fiue and thirtieth yeere of the reigne
b.2CH.15.2	And he went out to meet Asa, and said vnto him, Heare ye me, Asa, and all
b.2CH.15.3	Now for a long season Israel hath bene without the true God, and without a
b.2CH.15.4	But when they in their trouble did turne vnto the Lord God of Israel, and
b.2CH.15.5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that
b.2CH.15.6	And nation was destroyed of nation, and citie of citie: for God did vexe them
b.2CH.15.7	Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands bee weake: for your worke shall
b.2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard these words, and the prophesie of Oded the prophet, he
b.2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Iudah and Beniamin, and the strangers with them out of
b.2CH.1.6	And Solomon went vp thither to the brasen Altar before the Lord, which was at
b.2CH.16.1	In the sixe and thirtieth yeere of the reigne of Asa, Baasha king of Israel
b.2CH.16.10	Then Asa was wroth with the Seer, and put him in a prison-house; for he was
b.2CH.16.11	And behold, the actes of Asa first and last, lo, they are written in the
b.2CH.16.12	And Asa in the thirtie and ninth yeere of his reigne, was diseased in his
b.2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fourtieth yeere of
b.2CH.16.14	And they buried him in his owne sepulchres which he had made for himselfe in
b.2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out siluer and golde out of the treasures of the house of the
b.2CH.16.3	There is a league betweene me and thee, as there was betweene my father and
b.2CH.16.4	And Benhadad hearkened vnto king Asa, and sent the captaines of his armies
b.2CH.16.5	And it came to passe, when Baasha heard it, that hee left off building of
b.2CH.16.6	Then Asa the king tooke all Iudah, and they caried away the stones of Ramah,
b.2CH.16.7	And at that time Hanani the Seer came to Asa king of Iudah, and said vnto him,
b.2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge hoste, with very many charets
b.2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shewe
b.2CH.1.7	In that night did God appeare vnto Solomon, and saide vnto him; Aske what I
b.2CH.17.1	And Iehoshaphat his sonne reigned in his stead, and strengthened himselfe
b.2CH.17.10	And the feare of the Lord fell vpon all the kingdomes of the lands that were
b.2CH.17.11	Also some of the Philistines brought Iehoshaphat presents, and tribute siluer,
b.2CH.17.12	And Iehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly, and he built in Iudah castles, and
b.2CH.17.13	And he had much businesse in the cities of Iudah: and the men of warre,
b.2CH.17.14	And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of
b.2CH.17.15	And next to him was Iehohanan the captaine, and with him two hundred and
b.2CH.17.16	And next him was Amasiah the sonne of Zichri, who willingly offered himselfe
b.2CH.17.17	And of Beniamin, Eliada a mightie man of valour, and with him, armed men with
b.2CH.17.18	And next him was Iehoshabad, and with him an hundred and foure score
b.2CH.17.19	These waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fenced
b.2CH.17.2	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Iudah, and set garisons in
b.2CH.17.3	And the Lord was with Iehoshaphat, because hee walked in the first wayes of
b.2CH.17.4	But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandements, and
b.2CH.17.5	Therefore the Lord stablished the kingdome in his hand, and all Iudah brought
b.2CH.17.6	And his heart was lift vp in the wayes of the Lord: moreouer hee tooke away
b.2CH.17.7	Also in the third yeere of his reigne, hee sent to his princes, euen to
b.2CH.17.8	And with them hee sent Leuites, euen Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah,
b.2CH.17.9	And they taught in Iudah, and had the book of the Law of the Lord with them,
b.2CH.1.8	And Solomon saide vnto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father,
b.2CH.18.1	Now Iehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and ioyned affinitie with
b.2CH.18.10	And Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah, had made him hornes of yron, and said,
b.2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead, and
b.2CH.18.12	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah, spake to him, saying, Behold,
b.2CH.18.13	And Micaiah said, As the Lord liueth, euen what my God saith, that will I
b.2CH.18.14	And when hee was come to the king, the king sayd vnto him, Micaiah, shall we
b.2CH.18.15	And the king sayd to him, Howe many times shall I adiure thee, that thou say
b.2CH.18.16	Then he sayd, I did see all Israel scattered vpon the mountaines, as sheepe
b.2CH.18.17	(And the king of Israel sayd to Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that hee
b.2CH.18.18	Againe he sayd; Therefore heare the word of the Lord: I sawe the Lord sitting
b.2CH.18.19	And the Lord sayd, Who shall entise Ahab king of Israel, that hee may goe vp
b.2CH.18.2	And after certaine yeeres, he went downe to Ahab to Samaria: and Ahab killed
b.2CH.18.20	Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and sayd, I will
b.2CH.18.21	And hee sayd, I will goe out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
b.2CH.18.22	Nowe therefore behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these
b.2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah, came neere, and smote Micaiah vpon the
b.2CH.18.24	And Micaiah sayd, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt goe
b.2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel sayd, Take yee Micaiah, and carie him backe to Amon
b.2CH.18.26	And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feede him
b.2CH.18.27	And Micaiah sayd, If thou certainly returne in peace, then hath not the Lord
b.2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel, and Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah, went vp to Ramoth
b.2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel sayd vnto Iehoshaphat, I will disguise my selfe, and
b.2CH.18.3	And Ahab king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, Wilt thou goe
b.2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commaunded the captaines of the charets that were
b.2CH.18.31	And it came to passe when the captaines of the charets saw Iehoshaphat, that
b.2CH.18.32	For it came to passe, that when the captaines of the charets perceiued that
b.2CH.18.33	And a certaine man drew a bowe at a venture, and smote the king of Israel
b.2CH.18.34	And the battell increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed
b.2CH.18.4	And Iehoshaphat saide vnto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the
b.2CH.18.5	Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets foure hundred men,
b.2CH.18.6	But Iehoshaphat saide, Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord besides, that
b.2CH.18.7	And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we
b.2CH.18.8	And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and saide, Fetch
b.2CH.18.9	And the king of Israel and Iehoshaphat king of Iudah sate, either of them on
b.2CH.1.9	Now, O Lord God, let thy promise vnto Dauid my father be established: for thou
b.2CH.19.1	And Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah returned to his house in peace to Ierusalem.
b.2CH.19.10	And what cause soeuer shal come to you of your brethren that dwell in their
b.2CH.19.11	And behold, Amariah the chiefe Priest is ouer you in all matters of the Lord,
b.2CH.19.2	And Iehu the sonne of Hanani the seer, went out to meete him, and sayd to king
b.2CH.19.3	Neuerthelesse, there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken
b.2CH.19.4	And Iehoshaphat dwelt at Ierusalem: and hee went out againe through the
b.2CH.19.5	And he set Iudges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities of Iudah, city
b.2CH.19.6	And said to the Iudges, Take heed what ye doe: for yee iudge not for man, but
b.2CH.19.7	Wherefore now, let the feare of the Lord be vpon you, take heed and doe it:
b.2CH.19.8	Moreouer in Ierusalem did Iehoshaphat set of the Leuites, and of the Priests,
b.2CH.19.9	And hee charged them, saying, Thus shall yee doe in the feare of the Lord
b.2CH.20.1	It came to passe after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children
b.2CH.20.10	And now behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom thou
b.2CH.20.11	Beholde, I say, how they reward vs, to come to cast vs out of thy possession,
b.2CH.20.12	O our God, wilt thou not iudge them? for wee haue no might against this great
b.2CH.20.13	And all Iudah stood before the Lord, with their litle ones, their wiues and
b.2CH.20.14	Then vpon Iahaziel the sonne of Zechariah, the sonne of Benaiah, the sonne of
b.2CH.20.15	And he said, Hearken yee, all Iudah, and ye inhabitants of Ierusalem, and
b.2CH.20.16	To morrow goe ye downe against them: behold, they come vp by the cliffe of
b.2CH.20.17	Yee shall not neede to fight in this battell; set your selues, stand yee
b.2CH.20.18	And Iehoshaphat bowed his head, with his face to the ground: and all Iudah,
b.2CH.20.19	And the Leuites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of
b.2CH.20.2	Then there came some that tolde Iehoshaphat, saying, There commeth a great

b.2CH.20.24	And when Iudah came toward the watch-tower in the wildernesse, they looked
b.2CH.20.25	And when Iehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoile of them,
b.2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselues in the valley of Berachah;
b.2CH.20.27	Then they returned, euery man of Iudah and Ierusalem, and Iehoshaphat in the
b.2CH.20.28	And they came to Ierusalem with Psalteries, and harpes, and trumpets, vnto
b.2CH.20.29	And the feare of God was on all the kingdoms of those countreys, when they
b.2CH.20.3	And Iehoshaphat feared, and set himselfe to seeke the Lord, and proclaimed a
b.2CH.20.30	So the Realme of Iehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gaue him rest round

b.2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat first and last, behold, they are
b.2CH.20.35	And after this did Iehoshaphat king of Iudah ioine himselfe with Ahaziah king
b.2CH.20.36	And he ioyned himselfe with him to make ships to goe to Tarshish: and they
b.2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer the sonne of Dodanah of Mareshah, prophesied against Iehoshaphat,
b.2CH.20.4	And Iudah gathered themselues together, to aske helpe of the Lord: euen out of

b.2CH.20.6	And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heauen? and rulest
b.2CH.20.7	Art not thou our God, who didst driue out the inhabitants of this land before
b.2CH.20.8	And they dwelt therein, and haue built thee a Sanctuarie therein for thy Name,

b.2CH.21.12	And there came a writing to him from Eliiah the Prophet, saying, Thus saith
b.2CH.21.13	But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Iudah and
b.2CH.21.14	Behold, with a great plague wil the Lord smite thy people, and thy children,
b.2CH.21.15	And thou shalt haue great sicknesse by disease of thy bowels, vntil thy
b.2CH.21.16	Moreouer, the Lord stirred vp against Iehoram the spirit of the Philistines,
b.2CH.21.17	And they came vp into Iudah, and brake into it, and caried away all the
b.2CH.21.18	And after all this, the Lord smote him in his bowels, with an incurable
b.2CH.21.19	And it came to passe, that in processe of time, after the end of two yeres,
b.2CH.2.12	Huram said moreouer, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel that made heauen and
b.2CH.21.2	And he had brethren the sonnes of Iehoshaphat, Azariah, and Iehiel, and
b.2CH.21.20	Thirtie and two yeeres old was he when he began to reigne, and he reigned in
b.2CH.2.13	And now I haue sent a cunning man (indued with vnderstanding) of Huram my

b.2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of
b.2CH.2.17	And Solomon numbred all the strangers that were in the lande of Israel, after
b.2CH.21.7	Howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of Dauid, because of the couenant
b.2CH.2.18	And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and
b.2CH.21.8	In his dayes the Edomites reuolted from vnder the dominion of Iudah, and made
b.2CH.21.9	Then Iehoram went forth with his Princes, and all his charets with him: and he
b.2CH.2.2	And Solomon told out threescore and tenne thousand men to beare burdens, and
b.2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Ierusalem made Ahaziah his yongest sonne, king in his

b.2CH.22.11	But Iehoshabeath the daughter of the king, tooke Ioash the sonne of Ahaziah,
b.2CH.22.12	And he was with them hid in the house of God sixe yeeres, and Athaliah
b.2CH.22.2	Fourtie and two yeeres old was Ahaziah, when he began to reigne, and he
b.2CH.22.3	Hee also walked in the wayes of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his
b.2CH.22.4	Wherefore he did euill in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab: for
b.2CH.22.5	He walked also after their counsell, and went with Iehoram the sonne of Ahab
b.2CH.22.6	And he returned to bee healed in Iezreel, because of the wounds which were
b.2CH.22.7	And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by comming to Ioram: For when he was
b.2CH.22.8	And it came to passe, that when Iehu was executing iudgement vpon the house of
b.2CH.22.9	And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him (for he was hid in Samaria) and
b.2CH.2.3	And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou diddest deale with
b.2CH.23.1	And in the seuenth yeere Iehoiada strengthened himselfe, and tooke the
b.2CH.23.10	And hee set all the people (euery man hauing his weapon in his hand) from the

b.2CH.23.12	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the
b.2CH.23.13	And she looked, and behold, the king stood at his pillar, at the entring in,
b.2CH.23.14	Then Iehoiada the Priest brought out the captaines of hundreds, that were set
b.2CH.23.15	So they layd handes on her, and when shee was come to the entring of the
b.2CH.23.16	And Iehoiada made a couenant betweene him, and betweene all the people, and
b.2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it downe, and brake
b.2CH.23.18	Also Iehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of
b.2CH.23.19	And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which

b.2CH.23.20	And hee tooke the captaines of hundreds, and the nobles, and the gouernours
b.2CH.23.21	And all the people of the land reioyced, and the city was quiet, after that
b.2CH.23.3	And all the Congregation made a couenant with the king in the house of God:
b.2CH.23.4	This is the thing that yee shall doe, A third part of you entring on the
b.2CH.23.5	And a thirde part shall bee at the kings house, and a third part at the gate
b.2CH.23.6	But let none come into the house of the Lord, saue the Priests, &amp; they
b.2CH.23.7	And the Leuites shall compasse the king round about, euery man with his
b.2CH.23.8	So the Leuites and all Iudah did according to all things that Iehoiada the
b.2CH.23.9	Moreouer, Iehoiada the Priest deliuered to the captaines of hundreds, speares
b.2CH.2.4	Behold, I build an house to the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to
b.2CH.24.1	Ioash was seuen yeeres old when he beganne to reigne; and he reigned fortie
b.2CH.24.10	And all the Princes and all the people reioyced, and brought in, and cast
b.2CH.24.11	Now it came to passe that at what time the chest was brought vnto the kings
b.2CH.24.12	And the king and Iehoiada gaue it to such as did the worke of the seruice of
b.2CH.24.13	So the workemen wrought, and the worke was perfected by them: and they set
b.2CH.24.14	And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the

b.2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the citie of Dauid among the kings, because he had
b.2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Iehoiada, came the Princes of Iudah, and made
b.2CH.24.18	And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and serued groues
b.2CH.24.19	Yet hee sent prophets to them to bring them againe vnto the Lord, and they
b.2CH.24.2	And Ioash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, all the dayes of
b.2CH.24.20	And the spirit of God came vpon Zechariah the sonne of Iehoiada the priest,
b.2CH.24.21	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the
b.2CH.24.22	Thus Ioash the king remembred not the kindnesse which Iehoiada his father had
b.2CH.24.23	And it came to passe at the end of the yeere, that the hoste of Syria came vp
b.2CH.24.24	For the armie of the Syrians came with a small companie of men, and the Lord
b.2CH.24.25	And when they were departed from him (for they left him in great diseases)
b.2CH.24.26	And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the sonne of Shimeah an
b.2CH.24.27	Now concerning his sonnes, and the greatnesse of the burdens laide vpon him,
b.2CH.24.3	And Iehoiada tooke for him two wiues, and he begat sonnes and daughters.
b.2CH.24.4	And it came to passe after this that Ioash was minded to repaire the house of
b.2CH.24.5	And hee gathered together the priests and the Leuites, and saide to them, Go
b.2CH.24.6	And the king called for Iehoiada the chiefe, and saide vnto him, Why hast thou
b.2CH.24.7	For the sonnes of Athaliah that wicked woman, had broken vp the house of God,
b.2CH.24.8	And at the kings commandement they made a chest, and set it without, at the
b.2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation through Iudah &amp; Ierusalem, to bring in to the
b.2CH.2.5	And the house which I build, is great: for great is our God aboue all gods.
b.2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twentie and fiue yeeres olde when hee began to reigne, and hee
b.2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the armie that was come to him out of
b.2CH.25.11	And Amaziah strengthened himselfe, and ledde foorth his people, and went to
b.2CH.25.12	And other ten thousand left aliue, did the children of Iudah cary away
b.2CH.25.13	But the souldiers of the army which Amaziah sent backe, that they should not

b.2CH.25.15	Wherfore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and hee sent vnto
b.2CH.25.16	And it came to passe as hee talked with him, that the king said vnto him, Art
b.2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah king of Iudah tooke aduice, and sent to Ioash the sonne of
b.2CH.25.18	And Ioash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Iudah, saying, The thistle
b.2CH.25.19	Thou sayest, Loe, thou hast smitten the Edomites, and thine heart lifteth
b.2CH.25.2	And hee did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a
b.2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not heare: for it came of God, that he might deliuer them
b.2CH.25.21	So Ioash the King of Israel went vp, and they saw one another in the face,
b.2CH.25.22	And Iudah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled euery man to his
b.2CH.25.23	And Ioash the king of Israel tooke Amaziah king of Iudah the son of Ioash,
b.2CH.25.24	And hee tooke all the gold and the siluer, and all the vessels that were
b.2CH.25.25	And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash King of Iudah liued after the death of Ioash
b.2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not
b.2CH.25.27	Now after the time that Amaziah did turne away from following the Lord, they
b.2CH.25.28	And they brought him vpon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the
b.2CH.25.3	Now it came to passe when the kingdome was established to him, that he slew
b.2CH.25.4	But hee slewe not their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the
b.2CH.25.5	Moreouer, Amaziah gathered Iudah together, and made them Captaines ouer
b.2CH.25.6	Hee hired also an hundred thousand mightie men of valour, out of Israel, for
b.2CH.25.7	But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the armie of
b.2CH.25.8	But if thou wilt goe, doe it, bee strong for the battell: God shall make thee
b.2CH.25.9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall wee doe for the hundred
b.2CH.2.6	But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heauen, and heauen of
b.2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Iudah tooke Uzziah, who was sixteene yeeres old, and
b.2CH.26.10	Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many welles, for hee had much
b.2CH.26.11	Moreouer, Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to warre by
b.2CH.26.12	The whole number of the chiefe of the fathers of the mightie men of valour,
b.2CH.26.13	And vnder their hand was an armie, three hundred thousand, and seuen
b.2CH.26.14	And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the hoste, shields, and speares,
b.2CH.26.15	And hee made in Ierusalem engines inuented by cunning men, to bee on the
b.2CH.26.16	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted vp to his destruction: for he
b.2CH.26.17	And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourescore priests of
b.2CH.26.18	And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said vnto him, It perteineth not vnto
b.2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand, to burne incense, and
b.2CH.26.2	He built Eloth, and restored it to Iudah: after that the King slept with his
b.2CH.26.20	And Azariah the chiefe priest, and all the priests looked vpon him, and
b.2CH.26.21	And Uzziah the king was a leper vnto the day of his death, and dwelt in a
b.2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the actes of Uzziah first and last, did Isaiah the prophet
b.2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the
b.2CH.26.3	Sixteene yeeres old was Uzziah, when he began to reigne, and he reigned fiftie
b.2CH.26.4	And hee did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all
b.2CH.26.5	And hee sought God in the dayes of Zechariah, who had vnderstanding in the
b.2CH.26.6	And hee went foorth and warred against the Philistines, &amp; brake downe the
b.2CH.26.7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians, that
b.2CH.26.8	And the Ammonites gaue gifts to Uzziah, and his name spread abroad euen to the
b.2CH.26.9	Moreouer Uzziah built towers in Ierusalem at the corner gate, and at the
b.2CH.2.7	Send me now therefore a man, cunning to worke in gold and in siluer, and in
b.2CH.27.1	Iotham was twenty and fiue yeeres olde, when hee began to reigne, and hee
b.2CH.27.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all
b.2CH.27.3	He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and on the wall of Ophel, he
b.2CH.27.4	Moreouer hee built cities in the mountaines of Iudah, and in the forrests he
b.2CH.27.5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and preuailed against them. And
b.2CH.27.6	So Iotham became mightie, because he prepared his wayes before the Lord his
b.2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the actes of Iotham and all his warres, and his wayes, lo,
b.2CH.27.8	Hee was fiue and twentie yeeres olde when he began to reigne, and reigned
b.2CH.27.9	And Iotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of Dauid:
b.2CH.2.8	Send me also Cedar trees, firre trees, and Algume trees, out of Lebanon: (for
b.2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twentie yeeres olde when hee beganne to reigne, and he reigned
b.2CH.28.10	And now ye purpose to keepe vnder the children of Iudah and Ierusalem for
b.2CH.28.11	Now heare me therefore, and deliuer the captiues againe, which ye haue taken

b.2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captiues, and the spoile before the Princes, and
b.2CH.28.15	And the men which were expressed by name, rose vp and tooke the captiues, and
b.2CH.28.16	At that time did king Ahaz send vnto the kings of Assyria to helpe him.
b.2CH.28.17	For againe the Edomites had come and smitten Iudah, and caried away captiues.
b.2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had inuaded the cities of the low-countrey, and of the
b.2CH.28.19	For the Lord brought Iudah low, because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made
b.2CH.28.2	For he walked in the wayes of the Kings of Israel, and made also molten images
b.2CH.28.20	And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came vnto him, and distressed him, but
b.2CH.28.21	For Ahaz tooke away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and out of the
b.2CH.28.22	And in the time of this distresse did hee trespasse yet more against the
b.2CH.28.23	For he sacrificed vnto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said,
b.2CH.28.24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces
b.2CH.28.25	And in euery seuerall city of Iudah hee made high places to burne incense
b.2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts, and of all his wayes, first and last, behold, they
b.2CH.28.27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the citie, euen in
b.2CH.28.3	Moreouer, he burnt incense in the valley of the sonne of Hinnom, &amp; burnt
b.2CH.28.4	Hee sacrificed also, and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hils,
b.2CH.28.5	Wherefore the Lord his God deliuered him into the hand of the king of Syria,
b.2CH.28.6	For Pekah the sonne of Remaliah slew in Iudah an hundred &amp; twentie
b.2CH.28.7	And Zichri a mightie man of Ephraim, slue Maaseiah the kings sonne, and
b.2CH.28.8	And the children of Israel caried away captiue of their brethren, two hundred

b.2CH.2.9	Euen to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to

b.2CH.29.11	My sonnes, bee not now negligent: for the Lord hath chosen you to stand
b.2CH.29.12	Then the Leuites arose, Mahath the sonne of Amashai, and Ioel the sonne of
b.2CH.29.13	And of the sonnes of Elizaphan, Shimri, and Iehiel: and of the sonnes of
b.2CH.29.14	And of the sonnes of Heman, Iehiel, and Shimei: and of the sonnes of Ieduthun,
b.2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselues, and came
b.2CH.29.16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord, to cleanse
b.2CH.29.17	Now they began on the first day of the first moneth to sanctifie, and on the
b.2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We haue cleansed all the
b.2CH.29.19	Moreouer all the vessels which king Ahaz in his reigne did cast away in his
b.2CH.29.2	And hee did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all
b.2CH.29.20	Then Hezekiah the king rose earely, and gathered the rulers of the citie, and
b.2CH.29.21	And they brought seuen bullocks and seuen rammes, and seuen lambes, and seuen
b.2CH.29.22	So they killed the bullockes, and the priestes receiued the blood, and
b.2CH.29.23	And they brought foorth the hee goats for the sinne offering, before the king
b.2CH.29.24	And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood
b.2CH.29.25	And hee set the Leuites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with
b.2CH.29.26	And the Leuites stood with the instruments of Dauid, and the priestes with
b.2CH.29.27	And Hezekiah commaunded to offer the burnt offering vpon the altar: and when
b.2CH.29.28	And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the
b.2CH.29.29	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present
b.2CH.29.3	He, in the first yere of his reigne, in the first moneth, opened the doores of
b.2CH.29.30	Moreouer Hezekiah the king and the Princes, commanded the Leuites to sing
b.2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye haue consecrated your selues vnto the
b.2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought, was
b.2CH.29.33	And the consecrated things were, sixe hundred oxen, and three thousand sheepe.
b.2CH.29.34	But the Priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt
b.2CH.29.35	And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace
b.2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah reioyced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people:
b.2CH.29.4	And hee brought in the Priests, and the Leuites, and gathered them together
b.2CH.29.5	And said vnto them, Heare me, ye Leuites, sanctifie now your selues, and
b.2CH.29.6	For our fathers haue trespassed, and done that which was euill in the eyes of
b.2CH.29.7	Also they haue shut vp the doores of the Porch, and put out the lampes, and
b.2CH.29.8	Wherfore the wrath of the Lord was vpon Iudah and Ierusalem, and he hath
b.2CH.29.9	For loe, our fathers haue fallen by the sword, and our sonnes and our
b.2CH.30.1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Iudah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim
b.2CH.30.10	So the Posts passed from citie to citie, through the countrey of Ephraim and
b.2CH.30.11	Neuerthelesse, diuers of Asher, and Manasseh, and of Zebulun, humbled
b.2CH.30.12	Also in Iudah, the hand of God was to giue them one heart to doe the
b.2CH.30.13	And there assembled at Ierusalem much people, to keepe the feast of
b.2CH.30.14	And they arose and tooke away the altars that were in Ierusalem, and all the
b.2CH.30.15	Then they killed the Passeouer on the fourteenth day of the second moneth:
b.2CH.30.16	And they stood in their place after their maner, according to the Law of
b.2CH.30.17	For there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified: therefore
b.2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, euen many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar
b.2CH.30.19	That prepareth his heart to seeke God, the Lord God of his fathers, though

b.2CH.30.20	And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
b.2CH.30.21	And the children of Israel that were present at Ierusalem, kept the feast of
b.2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah spake comfortably vnto all the Leuites, that taught the good
b.2CH.30.23	And the whole assembly tooke counsel to keepe other seuen dayes: and they
b.2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah king of Iudah did giue to the Congregation, a thousand bullockes,
b.2CH.30.25	And all the Congregation of Iudah, with the Priests and the Leuites, and all
b.2CH.30.26	So there was great ioy in Ierusalem: for since the time of Solomon the sonne
b.2CH.30.27	Then the Priests the Leuites arose, and blessed the people: and their voice
b.2CH.30.3	For they could not keepe it at that time, because the Priests had not

b.2CH.30.5	So they established a decree, to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from
b.2CH.30.6	So the Postes went with the letters from the King and his Princes, throughout
b.2CH.30.7	And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed
b.2CH.30.8	Now be yee not stiffe-necked as your fathers were, but yeeld your selues vnto

b.2CH.3.10	And in the most holy place hee made two Cherubims of image work, and ouerlaid
b.2CH.3.11	And the wings of the Cherubims were twentie cubites long: one wing of the one
b.2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present, went out to the
b.2CH.31.10	And Azariah the chiefe priest of the house of Zadok, answered him &amp; said:
b.2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord, and
b.2CH.31.12	And brought in the offerings and the tithes, and the dedicate things,
b.2CH.31.13	And Iehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Ierimoth, and Iozabad,
b.2CH.31.14	And Kore the sonne of Immah the Leuite the porter toward the East, was ouer
b.2CH.31.15	And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Ieshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and
b.2CH.31.16	Beside their genealogie of males, from three yeeres old and vpward, euen vnto
b.2CH.31.17	Both to the genealogie of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the
b.2CH.31.18	And to the genealogie of all their litle ones, their wiues, and their sonnes,
b.2CH.31.19	Also of the sonnes of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the
b.2CH.3.12	And one wing of the other Cherub was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of
b.2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the Priests and the Leuites after their
b.2CH.31.20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout al Iudah, and wrought that which was good
b.2CH.31.21	And in euery worke that he began in the seruice of the house of God, and in
b.2CH.3.13	The wings of these Cherubims spread themselues forth twentie cubits: and they
b.2CH.31.3	He appointed also the kings portion of his substance, for the burnt offrings,
b.2CH.3.14	And he made the vaile of blue and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and
b.2CH.31.4	Moreouer, he commaunded the people that dwelt in Ierusalem, to giue the
b.2CH.3.15	Also hee made before the house, two pillars of thirtie and fiue cubites high,
b.2CH.31.5	And assoone as the commaundement came abroad, the children of Israel brought
b.2CH.3.16	And he made chaines, as in the Oracle, and put them on the heads of the
b.2CH.31.6	And concerning the children of Israel and Iudah, that dwelt in the cities of
b.2CH.3.17	And he reared vp the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and
b.2CH.31.7	In the third moneth they began to lay the foundation of the heapes, and
b.2CH.31.8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came, and saw the heapes, they blessed the
b.2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Leuites concerning the
b.2CH.3.2	And he began to build in the second day of the second moneth, in the fourth
b.2CH.32.1	After these things and the establishment therof, Sennacherib king of Assyria
b.2CH.32.10	Thus sayth Semacherib king of Assyria, Whereon doe ye trust, that yee abide
b.2CH.32.11	Doeth not Hezekiah perswade you to giue ouer your selues to die by famine and
b.2CH.32.12	Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places, and his altars, and
b.2CH.32.13	Know ye not what I and my fathers haue done vnto all the people of other
b.2CH.32.14	Who was there among all the gods of those nations, that my fathers vtterly
b.2CH.32.15	Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceiue you, nor perswade you on this manner,
b.2CH.32.16	And his seruants spake yet more against the Lord God, and against his seruant
b.2CH.32.17	Hee wrote also letters to raile on the Lord God of Israel, &amp; to speake
b.2CH.32.18	Then they cryed with a loude voice in the Iewes speech vnto the people of
b.2CH.32.19	And they spake against the God of Ierusalem, as against the gods of the
b.2CH.32.2	And when Hezekiah sawe that Sennacherib was come, and that hee was purposed to
b.2CH.32.20	For this cause Hezekiah the king, and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne of Amoz,
b.2CH.32.21	And the Lord sent an Angel, which cut off all the mightie men of valour, and
b.2CH.32.22	Thus the Lord saued Hezekiah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, from the hand
b.2CH.32.23	And many brought gifts vnto the Lord to Ierusalem, and presents to Hezekiah
b.2CH.32.24	In those dayes Hezekiah was sicke to the death, and prayed vnto the Lord: and
b.2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah rendred not againe, according to the benefit done vnto him: for
b.2CH.32.26	Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himselfe for the pride of his heart, (both
b.2CH.32.27	And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches, and honour: and he made himselfe
b.2CH.32.28	Store-houses also for the increase of corne, and wine and oile; and stalles
b.2CH.32.29	Moreouer, hee prouided him cities, and possessions of flockes &amp; heards in
b.2CH.32.3	He tooke counsel with his princes, and his mightie men, to stop the waters of
b.2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the vpper water-course of Gihon, and brought
b.2CH.32.31	Howbeit, in the businesse of the Embassadours of the Princes of Babylon, who
b.2CH.32.32	Now, the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodnesse, behold, they are
b.2CH.32.33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of
b.2CH.32.4	So there was gathered much people together, who stopt all the fountaines, and
b.2CH.32.5	Also he strengthened himselfe, and built vp all the wall that was broken, and
b.2CH.32.6	And hee set captaines of warre ouer the people, and gathered them together to
b.2CH.32.7	Be strong and couragious, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria,
b.2CH.32.8	With him is an arme of flesh, but with vs is the Lord our God to helpe vs, and
b.2CH.32.9	After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his seruants to Ierusalem (but
b.2CH.3.3	Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of
b.2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelue yeeres old when he began to reigne, and he reigned fiftie
b.2CH.33.10	And the Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not
b.2CH.33.11	Wherfore the Lord brought vpon them the captaines of the host of the king of
b.2CH.33.12	And when hee was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled
b.2CH.33.13	And prayed vnto him, and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication,
b.2CH.33.14	Now after this, hee built a wall without the citie of Dauid, on the Westside
b.2CH.33.15	And hee tooke away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the
b.2CH.33.16	And hee repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace
b.2CH.33.17	Neuerthelesse, the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet vnto
b.2CH.33.18	Nowe the rest of the actes of Manasseh, &amp; his prayer vnto his God, and
b.2CH.33.19	His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sinne, and his
b.2CH.33.2	But did that which was euil in the sight of the Lord, like vnto the
b.2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his owne house:
b.2CH.33.21	Amon was two and twentie yeeres old, when he beganne to reigne, and reigned
b.2CH.33.22	But he did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his
b.2CH.33.23	And humbled not himselfe before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled
b.2CH.33.24	And his seruants conspired against him, and slew him in his owne house.
b.2CH.33.25	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon,
b.2CH.33.3	For hee built againe the high places, which Hezekiah his father had broken
b.2CH.33.4	Also hee built altars in the house of the Lord, whereof the Lord had saide, In
b.2CH.33.5	And he built altars for all the host of heauen, in the two Courts of the house
b.2CH.33.6	And he caused his children to passe through the fire in the valley of the son
b.2CH.33.7	And hee set a carued image (the idole which he had made) in the house of God,
b.2CH.33.8	Neither will I any more remoue the foot of Israel from out of the land which I
b.2CH.33.9	So Manasseh made Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem to erre, and to doe

b.2CH.34.1	Iosiah was eight yeeres old when hee beganne to reigne, and he reigned in

b.2CH.34.12	And the men did the worke faithfully, and the ouerseers of them were Iahath,
b.2CH.34.13	Also they were ouer the bearers of burdens, and were ouerseers of all that
b.2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the
b.2CH.34.15	And Hilkiah answered and saide to Shaphan the scribe: I haue found the booke
b.2CH.34.16	And Shaphan caried the booke to the king, and brought the king word backe
b.2CH.34.17	And they haue gathered together the money that was found in the house of the
b.2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the scribe tolde the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath giuen
b.2CH.34.19	And it came to passe when the king had heard the words of the lawe, that he
b.2CH.34.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the
b.2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, and Abdon
b.2CH.34.21	Goe, enquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in
b.2CH.34.22	And Hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to Huldah the
b.2CH.34.23	And she answered them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Tell ye the man
b.2CH.34.24	Thus saith the Lord, behold, I will bring euill vpon this place, and vpon the
b.2CH.34.25	Because they haue forsaken mee, and haue burned incense vnto other gods, that
b.2CH.34.26	And as for the king of Iudah, who sent you to enquire of the Lord, so shal ye
b.2CH.34.27	Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy selfe before God,
b.2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt bee gathered to thy

b.2CH.34.3	For in the eight yeare of his reigne, while he was yet young, hee beganne to

b.2CH.34.31	And the King stood in his place, &amp; made a Couenant before the Lord, to
b.2CH.34.32	And he caused all that were present in Ierusalem and Beniamin, to stand to
b.2CH.34.33	And Iosiah tooke away all the abominations out of all the countreys that
b.2CH.34.4	And they brake downe the altars of Baalim in his presence, and the images that
b.2CH.34.5	And hee burnt the bones of the priests vpon their altars, and cleansed Iudah

b.2CH.34.7	And when he had broken downe the altars and the groues, and had beaten the

b.2CH.34.9	And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they deliuered the money that
b.2CH.3.5	And the greater house hee sieled with firre tree, which he ouerlaid with fine
b.2CH.35.1	Moreouer Iosiah kept a Passeouer vnto ye Lord in Ierusalem: and they killed
b.2CH.35.10	So the seruice was prepared, and the Priests stood in their place, and the
b.2CH.35.11	And they killed the Passeouer, and the Priestes sprinckled the blood from
b.2CH.35.12	And they remooued the burnt offerings, that they might giue according to the
b.2CH.35.13	And they rosted the Passeouer with fire, according to the ordinance: but the
b.2CH.35.14	And afterward they made ready for themselues, and for the Priests: because
b.2CH.35.15	And the singers the sonnes of Asaph, were in their place according to the
b.2CH.35.16	So all the seruice of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keepe the
b.2CH.35.17	And the children of Israel that were present, kept the Passeouer at that
b.2CH.35.18	And there was no Passeouer like to that, kept in Israel, from the dayes of
b.2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth yeere of the reigne of Iosiah, was this Passeouer kept.
b.2CH.35.2	And hee set the Priestes in their charges, and encouraged them to the seruice
b.2CH.35.20	After all this, when Iosiah had prepared the Temple, Necho king of Egypt came
b.2CH.35.21	But hee sent Embassadours to him, saying, What haue I to doe with thee, thou
b.2CH.35.22	Neuerthelesse Iosiah would not turne his face from him, but disguised
b.2CH.35.23	And the archers shot at king Iosiah: and the King saide to his seruants, Haue
b.2CH.35.24	His seruants therefore tooke him out of that charet, and put him in the

b.2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was one and twentie yeres old, when he began to reigne, and reigned
b.2CH.36.12	And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord his God, and
b.2CH.36.13	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him sweare by
b.2CH.36.14	Moreouer all the chiefe of the priests, and the people transgressed very
b.2CH.36.15	And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising vp
b.2CH.36.16	But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his wordes, and misused
b.2CH.36.17	Therefore hee brought vpon them the king of the Caldees, who slew their yong
b.2CH.36.18	And all the vessels of the house of God great and small, and the treasures of
b.2CH.36.19	And they burnt the house of God, and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem, and

b.2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also caried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon,
b.2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Iehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and
b.2CH.36.9	Iehoiachin was eight yeeres old when hee began to reigne, and hee reigned
b.2CH.3.7	Hee ouerlaid also the house, the beames, the postes and the wals thereof, and
b.2CH.3.8	And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was, according to the
b.2CH.3.9	And the weight of the nailes was fiftie shekels of gold: and he ouerlaide the
b.2CH.4.1	Moreouer he made an Altar of brasse, twentie cubites the length thereof, and
b.2CH.4.10	And he set the Sea on the rightside of the East end, ouer against the South.
b.2CH.4.11	And Huram made the pots, and the shouels, and the basens, and Huram finished
b.2CH.4.12	To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters, which were on
b.2CH.4.13	And foure hundred Pomegranats on the two wreathes: two rowes of Pomegranats
b.2CH.4.14	He made also bases; and lauers made he vpon the bases.
b.2CH.4.15	One Sea, &amp; twelue oxen vnder it.
b.2CH.4.16	The pots also, and the shouels, and the fleshhookes, and all their

b.2CH.4.9	Furthermore, hee made the court of the Priests, and the great court, and
b.2CH.5.1	Thus al the worke that Solomon made for the house of the Lord, was finished:
b.2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the Arke saue the two tables which Moses put therein at
b.2CH.5.11	And it came to passe when the Priests were come out of the holy place (for

b.2CH.5.14	So that the Priests could not stand to minister, by reason of the cloud: for
b.2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel, and all the heads of the Tribes,

b.2CH.7.17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walke before me, as Dauid thy father walked,
b.2CH.7.18	Then wil I stablish the throne of thy kingdome, according as I haue
b.2CH.7.19	But if yee turne away and forsake my Statutes and my Commandements which I
b.2CH.7.2	And the Priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory

b.2CH.7.21	And this house which is high, shall be an astonishment to euery one that
b.2CH.7.22	And it shalbe answered, Because they forsooke the Lord God of their fathers,
b.2CH.7.3	And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came downe, and the glory
b.2CH.7.4	Then the King and all the people, offered sacrifices before the Lord.
b.2CH.7.5	And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twentie and two thousand oxen, and an
b.2CH.7.6	And the Priests waited on their offices: the Leuites also with instruments of
b.2CH.7.7	Moreouer, Solomon hallowed the middle of the Court, that was before the house
b.2CH.7.8	Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seuen dayes, and all Israel with
b.2CH.7.9	And in the eight day they made a solemne assembly: for they kept the

b.2CH.8.10	And these were the chiefe of king Solomons officers, euen two hundred and
b.2CH.8.11	And Solomon brought vp the daughter of Pharaoh out of the citie of Dauid,
b.2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings vnto the Lord on the Altar of the Lord,
b.2CH.8.13	Euen after a certaine rate euery day, offering according to the commandement
b.2CH.8.14	And he appointed, according to the order of Dauid his father, the courses of
b.2CH.8.15	And they departed not from the commandement of the King vnto the Priests and
b.2CH.8.16	Now all the worke of Solomon was prepared vnto the day of the foundation of
b.2CH.8.17	Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land
b.2CH.8.18	And Huram sent him by the hands of his seruants, shippes, and seruants that
b.2CH.8.2	That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and
b.2CH.8.3	And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and preuailed against it.
b.2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor in the wildernesse, and all the store-cities, which he
b.2CH.8.5	Also he built Beth-horon the vpper, and Beth-horon the nether, fensed cities
b.2CH.8.6	And Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the charet-cities,
b.2CH.8.7	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
b.2CH.8.8	But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children
b.2CH.8.9	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no seruants for his worke: but
b.2CH.9.1	And when the Queene of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, shee came to prooue
b.2CH.9.10	And the seruants also of Huram, and the seruants of Solomon, which brought
b.2CH.9.11	And the king made of the Algume trees, terrises to the house of the Lord, and
b.2CH.9.12	And King Solomon gaue to the Queene of Sheba, all her desire, whatsoeuer she
b.2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one yeere, was sixe hundred
b.2CH.9.14	Besides that which chapmen and merchants brought: and all the kings of
b.2CH.9.15	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: sixe hundred
b.2CH.9.16	And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of
b.2CH.9.17	Moreouer the king made a great throne of yuorie, and ouerlaid it with pure
b.2CH.9.18	And there were sixe steps to the throne, with a footstoole of gold, which
b.2CH.9.19	And twelue lyons stood there on the one side and on the other, vpon the sixe
b.2CH.9.2	And Solomon tolde her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from
b.2CH.9.20	And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the
b.2CH.9.21	For the kings ships went to Tarshish with the seruants of Huram: euerie three
b.2CH.9.22	And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisedome.
b.2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to heare his
b.2CH.9.24	And they brought euery man his present, vessels of siluer, and vessels of

b.2CH.9.28	And they brought vnto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
b.2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the actes of Solomon first and last, are they not written in
b.2CH.9.3	And when the Queene of Sheba had seene the wisedome of Solomon, and the house
b.2CH.9.30	And Solomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel, fourtie yeeres.
b.2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and hee was buried in the citie of Dauid
b.2CH.9.4	And the meate of his table, and the sitting of his seruants, and the
b.2CH.9.5	And she said to the King, It was a true report which I heard in mine owne
b.2CH.9.6	Howbeit, I beleeued not their wordes, vntill I came, and mine eyes had seene
b.2CH.9.7	Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy seruants, which stand continually

b.2CO.10.1	Now I Paul my selfe beseech you, by the meekenes and gentlenesse of Christ,
b.2CO.10.10	For his letters (say they) are waighty and powerfull, but his bodily presence
b.2CO.10.11	Let such a one thinke this: that such as we are in word by letters, when we
b.2CO.10.12	For we dare not make our selues of the number, or compare our selues with
b.2CO.10.13	But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the
b.2CO.10.14	For we stretch not our selues beyond our measure as though wee reached not
b.2CO.10.15	Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other mens labours,
b.2CO.10.16	To preach the Gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another
b.2CO.10.17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
b.2CO.10.18	For, not he that commendeth himselfe is approued, but whom the Lord
b.2CO.10.2	But I beseech you, that I may not bee bold when I am present, with that
b.2CO.10.3	For though we walke in the flesh, we doe not warre after the flesh:
b.2CO.10.4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the
b.2CO.10.5	Casting down imaginations, and euery high thing that exalteth it selfe against
b.2CO.10.6	And hauing in a readinesse to reuenge all disobedience, when your obedience is

b.2CO.1.1	Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothie our brother,
b.2CO.1.10	Who deliuered vs from so great a death, and doeth deliuer: in whom we trust
b.2CO.1.11	You also helping together by prayer for vs, that for the gift bestowed vpon
b.2CO.11.1	Would to God you could beare with mee a little in my folly, &amp; in deede
b.2CO.11.10	As the trueth of Christ is in mee, no man shall stop mee of this boasting in

b.2CO.11.12	But what I doe, that I wil doe, that I may cut off occasion from them which
b.2CO.11.13	For such are false Apostles, deceitfull workers, transforming themselues into
b.2CO.11.14	And no marueile, for Sathan himselfe is transformed into an Angel of light.
b.2CO.11.15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also bee transformed as the
b.2CO.11.16	I say againe, Let no man thinke mee a foole; if otherwise, yet as a foole
b.2CO.11.17	That which I speake, I speake it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly
b.2CO.11.18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
b.2CO.11.19	For ye suffer fooles gladly, seeing ye your selues are wise.
b.2CO.1.12	For our reioycing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
b.2CO.11.2	For I am iealous ouer you with godly iealousie, for I haue espoused you to one
b.2CO.11.20	For ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man deuoure you, if a man

b.2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrewes? so am I: are they Israelites? so am I: are they the seed
b.2CO.11.23	Are they ministers of Christ? I speake as a foole, I am more: in labors more
b.2CO.11.24	Of the Iewes fiue times receiued I forty stripes saue one.
b.2CO.11.25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned: thrice I suffered
b.2CO.11.26	In iourneying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by
b.2CO.11.27	In wearinesse and painfulnesse, in watchings often, in hunger &amp; thirst,
b.2CO.11.28	Besides those things that are without, that which commeth vpon me dayly, the
b.2CO.11.29	Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not?
b.2CO.1.13	For we write none other things vnto you, then what you reade or acknowledge,
b.2CO.11.3	But I feare lest by any meanes, as the Serpent beguiled Eue through his
b.2CO.11.30	If I must needes glory, I will glory of the things which concerne mine
b.2CO.11.31	The God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which is blessed for euermore,
b.2CO.11.32	In
b.2CO.11.33	And through a window in a basket was I let downe, by the wall, and escaped
b.2CO.1.14	As also you haue acknowledged vs in part, that we are your reioycing, euen as

b.2CO.1.16	And to passe by you into Macedonia, and to come againe out of Macedonia vnto
b.2CO.11.6	But though I be rude in speach, yet not in knowledge; but we haue bene
b.2CO.1.17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I vse lightnesse? or the things that I
b.2CO.11.7	Haue I committed an offence in abasing my selfe, that you might be exalted,
b.2CO.1.18	But as God is true, our word toward you, was not yea and nay.
b.2CO.11.8	I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them to doe you seruice.
b.2CO.1.19	For the Sonne of God Iesus Christ, who was preached among you by vs, euen by
b.2CO.11.9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: For

b.2CO.1.20	For all the promises of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen, vnto the glory
b.2CO.1.21	Now hee which stablisheth vs with you, in Christ, and hath anoynted vs, is
b.2CO.12.1	It is not expedient for me, doubtlesse, to glory, I wil come to visions and
b.2CO.12.10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproches, in necessities, in
b.2CO.12.11	I am become a foole in glorying, ye haue compelled me. For I ought to haue
b.2CO.12.12	Truely the signes of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in
b.2CO.12.13	For what is it wherein yee were inferior to other Churches, except it bee
b.2CO.12.14	Behold, the third time I am readie to come to you, and I will not bee
b.2CO.12.15	And I wil very gladly spend and bee spent for you, though the more abundantly
b.2CO.12.16	But be it so: I did not burthen you: neuerthelesse beeing craftie, I caught
b.2CO.12.17	Did I make a gaine of you by any of them, whom I sent vnto you?
b.2CO.12.18	I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother: did Titus make a gaine of
b.2CO.12.19	Againe, thinke you that we excuse our selues vnto you? wee speake before God
b.2CO.1.22	Who hath also sealed vs, and giuen the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
b.2CO.12.2	I knewe a man in Christ aboue foureteene yeeres agoe, whether in the body, I
b.2CO.12.20	For I feare lest when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that
b.2CO.12.21	And least when I come againe, my God will humble mee among you, and that I
b.2CO.1.23	Moreouer, I call God for a record vpon my soule, that to spare you I came not
b.2CO.12.3	And I knew such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell,
b.2CO.1.24	Not for that we haue dominion ouer your faith, but are helpers of your ioy:
b.2CO.12.4	How that he was caught vp into
b.2CO.12.5	Of such a one will I glory, yet of my selfe I will not glory, but in mine
b.2CO.12.6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a foole: for I will say the
b.2CO.12.7	And least I should bee exalted aboue measure through the abundance of the
b.2CO.12.8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from mee.
b.2CO.12.9	And he said vnto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made
b.2CO.1.3	Blessed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of
b.2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am comming to you: in the mouth of two or three
b.2CO.13.10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should vse
b.2CO.13.11	Finally, brethren, farewell: Bee perfect, bee of good comfort, bee of one
b.2CO.13.12	Greet one another with an holy kisse.
b.2CO.13.13	All the Saints salute you.
b.2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Iesus Christ, and the loue of God, and the communion of
b.2CO.13.2	I told you before, and foretell you as if I were present the second time, and
b.2CO.13.3	Since ye seeke a proofe of Christ, speaking in me, which to you-ward is not
b.2CO.13.4	For though hee was crucified through weaknesse, yet he liueth by the power of
b.2CO.13.5	Examine your selues, whether ye be in the faith: proue your owne selues. Know
b.2CO.13.6	But I trust that yee shall knowe that we are not reprobates.
b.2CO.13.7	Now I pray to God, that ye doe no euill, not that we should appeare approued,
b.2CO.13.8	For wee can doe nothing against the trueth, but for the trueth.
b.2CO.13.9	For wee are glad when wee are weake, and ye are strong: and this also we wish,
b.2CO.1.4	Who comforteth vs in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them
b.2CO.1.5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in vs, so our consolation also
b.2CO.1.6	And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and saluation, which
b.2CO.1.7	And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the
b.2CO.1.8	For we would not, brethren, haue you ignorant of our trouble which came to vs
b.2CO.1.9	But we had the sentence of death in our selues, that we should not trust in
b.2CO.2.1	But I determined this with my selfe, that I would not come againe to you in
b.2CO.2.10	To whom yee forgiue any thing, I forgiue also: for if I forgaue any thing, to
b.2CO.2.11	Lest Satan should get an aduantage of vs: for wee are not ignorant of his
b.2CO.2.12	Furthermore when I came to Troas, to preach Christs Gospel, and a doore was
b.2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother, but taking
b.2CO.2.14	Now thankes bee vnto God, which alwayes causeth vs to triumph in Christ, and
b.2CO.2.15	For wee are vnto God, a sweet sauour of Christ, in them that are saued, and
b.2CO.2.16	To the one wee are the sauour of death vnto death; and to the other, the
b.2CO.2.17	For wee are not as many which corrupt the word of God: but as of sinceritie,
b.2CO.2.2	For if I make you sorie, who is hee then that maketh mee glad, but the same
b.2CO.2.3	And I wrote this same vnto you, least when I came, I should haue sorrow from
b.2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote vnto you with many
b.2CO.2.5	But if any haue caused griefe, hee hath not grieued mee, but in part: that I
b.2CO.2.6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.
b.2CO.2.7	So that contrarywise, yee ought rather to forgiue him, and comfort him, lest
b.2CO.2.8	Wherefore I beseech you, that you would confirme your loue towards him.
b.2CO.2.9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proofe of you, whether
b.2CO.3.1	Doe wee begin againe to commend our selues? or need wee, as some others,
b.2CO.3.10	For euen that which was made glorious, had no glorie in this respect by
b.2CO.3.11	For if that which is done away, was glorious, much more that which remaineth
b.2CO.3.12	Seeing then that wee haue such hope, we vse great plainnesse of speech.
b.2CO.3.13	And not as Moses, which put a vaile ouer his face, that the children of
b.2CO.3.14	But their mindes were blinded: for vntill this day remaineth the same vaile
b.2CO.3.15	But euen vnto this day, when Moses is read, the vaile is vpon their heart.
b.2CO.3.16	Neuerthelesse, when it shall turne to the Lord, the vaile shall be taken
b.2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
b.2CO.3.18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glasse the glory of the Lord,
b.2CO.3.2	Ye are our Epistle written in our hearts, knowen and read of all men.
b.2CO.3.3	Forasmuch as yee are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred
b.2CO.3.4	And such trust haue wee through Christ to Godward:
b.2CO.3.5	Not that wee are sufficient of our selues to thinke any thing as of our selues:
b.2CO.3.6	Who also hath made vs able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter,
b.2CO.3.7	But if the ministration of death written, and ingrauen in stones, was
b.2CO.3.8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit, be rather glorious?
b.2CO.3.9	For if the ministration of condemnation bee glory, much more doth the
b.2CO.4.1	Therefore, seeing we haue this ministery, as we haue receiued mercie wee faint
b.2CO.4.10	Alwayes bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Iesus, that the life
b.2CO.4.11	For we which liue, are always deliuered vnto death for Iesus sake, that the
b.2CO.4.12	So then death worketh in vs, but life in you.
b.2CO.4.13	We hauing the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I beleeued,
b.2CO.4.14	Knowing that hee which raised vp the Lord Iesus, shall raise vp vs also by
b.2CO.4.15	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundat grace might, through the
b.2CO.4.16	For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the
b.2CO.4.17	For our light affliction, which is but for a momet, worketh for vs a farre
b.2CO.4.18	While we looke not at the things which are seene, but at ye things which are
b.2CO.4.2	But haue renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftines,
b.2CO.4.3	But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
b.2CO.4.4	In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which beleeue
b.2CO.4.5	For we preach not our selues, but Christ Iesus the Lord, and our selues your
b.2CO.4.6	For God who commaunded the light to shine out of darkenes, hath shined in our
b.2CO.4.7	But we haue this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellencie of the
b.2CO.4.8	Wee are troubled on euery side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not
b.2CO.4.9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast downe, but not destroyed.
b.2CO.5.1	For we know, that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolued, wee
b.2CO.5.10	For we must all appeare before the iudgement seat of Christ, that euery one
b.2CO.5.11	Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perswade men; but we are made
b.2CO.5.12	For we commend not our selues againe vnto you, but giue you occasion to glory
b.2CO.5.13	For whether wee bee besides our selues, it is to God: or whether we bee
b.2CO.5.14	For the loue of Christ constreineth vs, because wee thus iudge: that if one
b.2CO.5.15	And that he died for all, that they which liue, should not hencefoorth liue
b.2CO.5.16	Wherefore hencefoorth know we no man, after the flesh: yea, though we haue
b.2CO.5.17	Therfore if any man be in Christ, hee is a new creature: old things are past
b.2CO.5.18	And all things are of God, who hath reconciled vs to himselfe by Iesus
b.2CO.5.19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world vnto himselfe, not
b.2CO.5.2	For in this we grone earnestly, desiring to be clothed vpon with our house,
b.2CO.5.20	Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by vs;
b.2CO.5.21	For he hath made him to be sinne for vs, who knewe no sinne, that wee might
b.2CO.5.3	If so be that being clothed we shal not be found naked.
b.2CO.5.4	For, we that are in this tabernacle, doe grone, being burdened, not for that
b.2CO.5.5	Now he that hath wrought vs for the selfe same thing, is God, who also hath
b.2CO.5.6	Therefore we are alwayes confident, knowing that whilest wee are at home in
b.2CO.5.7	(For we walke by faith, not by sight.)
b.2CO.5.8	We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to
b.2CO.5.9	Wherefore we labour, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of
b.2CO.6.1	Wee then, as workers together with him, beseech you also, that ye receiue not
b.2CO.6.10	As sorrowfull, yet alway reioycing: as poore, yet making many rich: as hauing
b.2CO.6.11	O yee Corinthians, our mouth is open vnto you, our heart is enlarged.
b.2CO.6.12	Yee are not straitened in vs, but yee are straitned in your owne bowels.
b.2CO.6.13	Nowe for a recompense in the same, (I speake as vnto my children) be ye also
b.2CO.6.14	Be ye not vnequally yoked together with vnbeleeuers: for what fellowship hath
b.2CO.6.15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that beleeueth,
b.2CO.6.16	And what agreement hath the
b.2CO.6.17	Wherefore come out from among them, and bee yee separate, saieth the Lord,
b.2CO.6.18	And will bee a Father vnto you, and ye shall bee my sonnes and daughters,
b.2CO.6.2	(For he saith, I haue heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of
b.2CO.6.3	Giuing no offence in any thing, that the ministery be not blamed:
b.2CO.6.4	But in all things approuing our selues, as the Ministers of God, in much
b.2CO.6.5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in
b.2CO.6.6	By purenesse, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindnesse, by the holy
b.2CO.6.7	By the worde of trueth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousnesse,
b.2CO.6.8	By honour and dishonour, by euil report and good report, as deceiuers and yet
b.2CO.6.9	As vnknowen, &amp; yet wel knowen: as dying, and behold, we liue: as
b.2CO.7.1	Hauing therefore these promises (dearely beloued) let vs cleanse our selues
b.2CO.7.10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to saluation not to be repented of, but
b.2CO.7.11	For behold this selfe same thing that yee sorrowed after a godly sort, what
b.2CO.7.12	Wherefore though I wrote vnto you, I did it not for his cause that had done
b.2CO.7.13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort, yea and exceedingly the more
b.2CO.7.14	For if I haue boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we

b.2CO.7.7	And not by his comming onely, but by the consolation wherewith hee was
b.2CO.7.8	For though I made you sory with a letter, I doe not repent, though I did
b.2CO.7.9	Now I reioyce, not that ye were made sorie, but that ye sorrowed to

b.2KI.10.13	Iehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Iudah, and said, Who are ye?
b.2KI.10.14	And hee said, Take them aliue. And they tooke them aliue, and slew them at

b.2KI.10.27	And they brake downe the image of Baal, and brake downe the house of Baal,

b.2KI.16.6	At that time Rezin king of Syria, recouered Elath to Syria, &amp; draue the
b.2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy
b.2KI.16.8	And Ahaz tooke the siluer and gold that was found in the house of the Lord,
b.2KI.16.9	And the king of Assyria hearkened vnto him: for the king of Assyria went vp
b.2KI.1.7	And hee said vnto them, What maner of man was he which came vp to meet you,
b.2KI.17.1	In the twelfth yeere of Ahaz, king of Iudah, began Hoshea the sonne of Elah to
b.2KI.17.10	And they set them vp images, and groues in euery high hill, and vnder euery
b.2KI.17.11	And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom
b.2KI.17.12	For they serued idoles, whereof the Lord had said vnto them, Yee shall not
b.2KI.17.13	Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Iudah, by all the
b.2KI.17.14	Notwithstanding, they would not heare, but hardened their neckes, like to the
b.2KI.17.15	And they reiected his Statutes, and his Couenant that hee made with their
b.2KI.17.16	And they left all the Commandements of the Lord their God, and made them
b.2KI.17.17	And they caused their sonnes and their daughters to passe through the fire,
b.2KI.17.18	Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and remoued them out of his
b.2KI.17.19	Also Iudah kept not the Commandements of the Lord their God, but walked in
b.2KI.17.2	And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord, but not as the
b.2KI.17.20	And the Lord reiected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and
b.2KI.17.21	For he rent Israel from the house of Dauid, and they made Ieroboam the sonne
b.2KI.17.22	For the children of Israel walked in al the sinnes of Ieroboam which he did,
b.2KI.17.23	Untill the Lord remoued Israel out of his sight, as hee had said by all his
b.2KI.17.24	And the King of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from
b.2KI.17.25	And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not
b.2KI.17.26	Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou
b.2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carie thither one of the priests
b.2KI.17.28	Then one of the priests whom they had caried away from Samaria, came and
b.2KI.17.29	Howbeit, euery nation made gods of their owne, and put them in the houses of
b.2KI.17.3	Against him came vp Shalmaneser king of Assyria, and Hoshea became his seruant,
b.2KI.17.30	And the men of Babylon made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal,
b.2KI.17.31	And the Auites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharuites burnt their
b.2KI.17.32	So they feared the Lord, and made vnto themselues of the lowest of them
b.2KI.17.33	They feared the Lord, and serued their owne gods, after the maner of the
b.2KI.17.34	Unto this day they doe after the former maners: they feare not the Lord,
b.2KI.17.35	With whom the Lord had made a Couenant, and charged them, saying, Yee shall
b.2KI.17.36	But the Lord, who brought you vp out of the land of Egypt, with great power,
b.2KI.17.37	And the Statutes, and the Ordinances, and the Law, and the Commandement which
b.2KI.17.38	And the Couenant that I haue made with you, ye shall no forget, neither shall
b.2KI.17.39	But the Lord your God yee shall feare, and he shall deliuer you out of the
b.2KI.17.4	An the king of Assyria found conspiracie in Hoshea: for hee had sent
b.2KI.17.40	Howbeit, they did not hearken, but they did after their former maner.
b.2KI.17.41	So these nations feared the Lord, and serued their grauen images, both their
b.2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came vp thorowout all the land, and went vp to
b.2KI.17.6	In the ninth yeere of Hoshea, the king of Assyria tooke Samaria, and caried
b.2KI.17.7	For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their
b.2KI.17.8	And walked in the statutes of the heathen, (whom the Lord cast out from before
b.2KI.17.9	And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right,
b.2KI.1.8	And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather
b.2KI.18.1	Now it came to passe in the third yere of Hoshea sonne of Elah king of Israel,
b.2KI.18.10	And at the end of three yeeres they tooke it: euen in the sixt yeere of
b.2KI.18.11	And the king of Assyria did carie away Israel vnto Assyria, and put them in
b.2KI.18.12	Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his
b.2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth yeere of king Hezekiah, did Sennacherib king of Assyria
b.2KI.18.14	And Hezekiah king of Iudah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I
b.2KI.18.15	And Hezekiah gaue him all the siluer that was found in the house of the Lord,
b.2KI.18.16	At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doores of the temple of
b.2KI.18.17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh, from Lachish
b.2KI.18.18	And when they had called to the king there came out to them Eliakim the sonne
b.2KI.18.19	And Rabshakeh said vnto them, Speake yee now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the
b.2KI.18.2	Twentie and fiue yeeres old was he when hee began to reigne, and hee reigned
b.2KI.18.20	Thou sayest, (but they are but vaine words) I haue counsell and strength for
b.2KI.18.21	Now behold, thou trustest vpon the staffe of this bruised reed, euen vpon
b.2KI.18.22	But if ye say vnto me, We trust in the Lord our God: is not that hee whose
b.2KI.18.23	Now therefore, I pray thee, giue pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and
b.2KI.18.24	How then wilt thou turne away the face of one captaine of the least of my
b.2KI.18.25	Am I now come vp without the Lord against this place, to destroy it? The Lord
b.2KI.18.26	Then said Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Ioah, vnto Rabshakeh,
b.2KI.18.27	But Rabshakeh sayd vnto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to
b.2KI.18.28	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loude voice in the Iewes language, and
b.2KI.18.29	Thus sayth the king, Let not Hezekiah deceiue you, for he shall not be able
b.2KI.18.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all
b.2KI.18.30	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely
b.2KI.18.31	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus sayth the king of Assyria, Make an
b.2KI.18.32	Untill I come and take you away to a land like your owne land, a land of
b.2KI.18.33	Hath any of the gods of the nations deliuered at all his land out of the hand
b.2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharuaim,
b.2KI.18.35	Who are they among all the gods of the countreys, that haue deliuered their
b.2KI.18.36	But the people helde their peace, and answered him not a word: for the kings
b.2KI.18.37	Then came Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, which was ouer the houshold, and
b.2KI.18.4	He remooued the high places, and brake the images, and cut downe the groues,
b.2KI.18.5	He trusted in the Lord God of Israel, so that after him was none like him
b.2KI.18.6	For he claue to the Lord, and departed not from following him, but kept his
b.2KI.18.7	And the Lord was with him, and hee prospered whithersoeuer hee went forth: and
b.2KI.18.8	He smote the Philistines euen vnto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the
b.2KI.18.9	And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of king Hezekiah, (which was the
b.2KI.1.9	Then the King sent vnto him a captaine of fiftie, with his fiftie: and he went
b.2KI.19.1	And it came to passe when King Hezekiah heard it, that hee rent his clothes,
b.2KI.19.10	Thus shall ye speake to Hezekiah king of Iudah, saying, Let not thy God in
b.2KI.19.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria haue done to all lands, by
b.2KI.19.12	Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed?
b.2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the citie
b.2KI.19.14	And Hezekiah receiued the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it:
b.2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel, which
b.2KI.19.16	Lord, bow downe thine eare, and heare: open, Lord, thine eyes; and see: and
b.2KI.19.17	Of a trueth, Lord, the kings of Assyria haue destroyed the nations and their
b.2KI.19.18	And haue cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work
b.2KI.19.19	Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, saue thou vs out of his hand,
b.2KI.19.2	And hee sent Eliakim, which was ouer the houshold, and Shebna the Scribe, and
b.2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord
b.2KI.19.21	This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him, The Uirgin, the
b.2KI.19.22	Whome hast thou reproched and blasphemed? And against whome hast thou exalted
b.2KI.19.23	By thy messengers thou hast reproched the Lord, and hast said, With the
b.2KI.19.24	I haue digged &amp; drunke strange waters, and with the sole of my feete haue
b.2KI.19.25	Hast thou not heard long agoe, how I haue done it, and of ancient times that
b.2KI.19.26	Therefore their Inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and
b.2KI.19.27	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage
b.2KI.19.28	Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult is come vp into mine eares,
b.2KI.19.29	And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, Yee shall eate this yeere such things as
b.2KI.19.3	And they sayd vnto him, Thus sayth Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and
b.2KI.19.30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah, shall yet againe take
b.2KI.19.31	For out of Ierusalem shall goe forth a remnant, and they that escape out of
b.2KI.19.32	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not
b.2KI.19.33	By the way that hee came, by the same shal he returne, and shal not come into
b.2KI.19.34	For I will defend this citie, to saue it, for mine owne sake, and for my
b.2KI.19.35	And it came to passe that night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and
b.2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at
b.2KI.19.37	And it came to passe as hee was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,
b.2KI.19.4	It may be, the Lord thy God will heare all the words of Rabshakeh whome the
b.2KI.19.5	So the seruants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
b.2KI.19.6	And Isaiah said vnto them, Thus shal ye say to your master, Thus saith the
b.2KI.19.7	Behold, I will send a blast vpon him, and he shall heare a rumour, and shall
b.2KI.19.8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah:
b.2KI.19.9	And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, hee is come out to
b.2KI.20.1	In those dayes was Hezekiah sicke vnto death: and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne
b.2KI.20.10	And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go downe tenne
b.2KI.20.11	And Isaiah the Prophet cryed vnto the Lord, and he brought the shadow tenne
b.2KI.20.12	At that time Berodach-Baladan the sonne of Baladan King of Babylon, sent
b.2KI.20.13	And Hezekiah hearkened vnto them, and shewed them the house of his precious
b.2KI.20.14	Then came Isaiah the Prophet vnto King Hezekiah, and sayde vnto him, What
b.2KI.20.15	And he said, What haue they seene in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All
b.2KI.20.16	And Isaiah said vnto Hezekiah, Heare the word of the Lord.
b.2KI.20.17	Behold, the dayes come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy
b.2KI.20.18	And of thy sonnes that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall
b.2KI.20.19	Then said Hezekiah vnto Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast
b.2KI.20.2	Then hee turned his face to the wall, and prayed vnto the Lord, saying;
b.2KI.20.20	And the rest of the actes of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how hee made a
b.2KI.20.21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his sonne reigned in his
b.2KI.20.3	I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how I haue walked before thee in trueth,
b.2KI.20.4	And it came to passe afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the
b.2KI.20.5	Turne againe, and tell Hezekiah the captaine of my people, Thus saith the
b.2KI.20.6	And I will adde vnto thy dayes fifteene yeeres, and I will deliuer thee, and
b.2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, Take a lumpe of figs. And they tooke and layd it on the boile,
b.2KI.20.8	And Hezekiah said vnto Isaiah, What shall bee the signe that the Lord wil
b.2KI.20.9	And Isaiah said, This signe shalt thou haue of the Lord, that the Lord will
b.2KI.2.1	And it came to passe when the Lord would take vp Elijah into heauen by a
b.2KI.2.10	And hee said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: neuerthelesse, if thou see me,
b.2KI.2.11	And it came to passe as they still went on and talked, that beholde, there
b.2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelue yeres olde when hee beganne to reigne, and reigned fiftie
b.2KI.21.10	And the Lord spake by his seruants the Prophets, saying,
b.2KI.21.11	Because Manasseh king of Iudah hath done these abominations, and hath done
b.2KI.21.12	Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such euill
b.2KI.21.13	And I will stretch ouer Ierusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the
b.2KI.21.14	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliuer them into the
b.2KI.21.15	Because they haue done that which was euill in my sight, and haue prouoked me
b.2KI.21.16	Moreouer, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled
b.2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the actes of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sinne
b.2KI.21.18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his owne
b.2KI.21.19	Amon was twentie and two yeres old when he began to reigne, and he reigned
b.2KI.2.12	And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the charet of Israel,
b.2KI.21.2	And hee did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord, after the
b.2KI.21.20	And he did that which was euill in the sight of the Lord, as his father
b.2KI.21.21	And he walked in all the wayes that his father walked in, and serued the
b.2KI.21.22	And he forsooke the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the
b.2KI.21.23	And the seruants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his owne
b.2KI.21.24	And the people of the land slew al them that had conspired against king Amon,
b.2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did, are they not written in the
b.2KI.21.26	And he was buried in his sepulchre, in the garden of Uzza, and Iosiah his
b.2KI.2.13	He tooke vp also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and
b.2KI.21.3	For he built vp againe the high places, which Hezekiah his father had
b.2KI.2.14	And he tooke the mantle of Eliiah that fell from him, and smote the waters,
b.2KI.21.4	And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord sayd, In
b.2KI.2.15	And when the sonnes of the Prophets which were to view at Iericho, saw him,
b.2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heauen, in the two courts of the house
b.2KI.2.16	And they said vnto him, Behold now, there bee with thy seruants fiftie strong
b.2KI.21.6	And he made his sonne passe thorow the fire, and obserued times, and vsed
b.2KI.2.17	And when they vrged him, till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent
b.2KI.21.7	And he set a grauen image of the groue that he had made, in the house, of
b.2KI.2.18	And when they came againe to him (for he taried at Iericho) hee said vnto
b.2KI.21.8	Neither will I make the feete of Israel mooue any more out of the land, which
b.2KI.2.19	And the men of the city said vnto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation
b.2KI.21.9	But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to doe more euill then did
b.2KI.2.2	And Elijah said vnto Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lord hath sent
b.2KI.2.20	And hee said, Bring mee a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought
b.2KI.2.21	And he went forth vnto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there,
b.2KI.22.1	Iosiah was eight yeeres old when hee beganne to reigne, and hee reigned
b.2KI.22.10	And Shaphan the Scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the Priest hath

b.2KI.22.13	Goe yee, enquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Iudah,
b.2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the Priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went

b.2KI.22.17	Because they haue forsaken me, and haue burnt incense vnto other gods, that
b.2KI.22.18	But to the king of Iudah which sent you to enquire of the Lord, Thus shall
b.2KI.22.19	Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thy selfe before the
b.2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed vnto this day, according to the saying of Elisha,
b.2KI.22.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all
b.2KI.22.20	Behold therefore, I will gather thee vnto thy fathers, and thou shalt be
b.2KI.2.23	And he went vp from thence vnto Bethel: and as hee was going vp by the way,
b.2KI.22.3	And it came to passe in the eighteenth yeere of king Iosiah, that the king

b.2KI.22.7	Howbeit, there was no reckoning made with them, of the money that was
b.2KI.22.8	And Hilkiah the high Priest said vnto Shaphan the Scribe, I haue found the
b.2KI.22.9	And Shaphan the Scribe came to the king, and brought the king word againe, and
b.2KI.2.3	And the sonnes of the Prophets that were at Bethel, came foorth to Elisha, and
b.2KI.23.1	And the king sent, and they gathered vnto him all the Elders of Iudah, and of

b.2KI.23.18	And he said, Let him alone: let no man moue his bones: so they let his bones

b.2KI.23.2	And the king went vp into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Iudah, and
b.2KI.23.20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, vpon the

b.2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth yeere of king Iosiah, wherein this Passeouer was holden
b.2KI.23.24	Moreouer the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images,
b.2KI.23.25	And like vnto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with
b.2KI.23.26	Notwithstanding, the Lord turned not from the fiercenesse of his great wrath,
b.2KI.23.27	And the Lord said, I will remoue Iudah also out of my sight, as I haue

b.2KI.4.3	Then hee said, Goe, borrow thee vessels abroad, of all thy neighbours; euen
b.2KI.4.30	And the mother of the childe said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule

b.2KI.4.34	And he went vp, and lay vpon the child, and put his mouth vpon his mouth, and
b.2KI.4.35	Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro, and went vp, and
b.2KI.4.36	And hee called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So hee called her: and
b.2KI.4.37	Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed her selfe to the ground,
b.2KI.4.38	And Elisha came againe to Gilgal, and there was a dearth in the land, and the

b.2KI.4.41	But he said, Then bring meale. And he cast it into the pot: And he said,
b.2KI.4.42	And there came a man from Baal-Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of

b.2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they did eate, and left thereof, according to
b.2KI.4.5	So shee went from him, and shut the doore vpon her, &amp; vpon her sonnes: who

b.2KI.4.7	Then she came, and told the man of God: and he said, Goe, sell the oyle, and
b.2KI.4.8	And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman;
b.2KI.4.9	And shee said vnto her husband, Behold now, I perceiue that this is an holy
b.2KI.5.1	Now Naaman captaine of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his

b.2KI.5.14	Then went he downe, and dipped himselfe seuen times in Iordan, according to
b.2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and
b.2KI.5.16	But he said, As the Lord liueth, before whom I stand, I will receiue none:
b.2KI.5.17	And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be giuen to thy seruant
b.2KI.5.18	In this thing the Lord pardon thy seruant, that when my master goeth into the
b.2KI.5.19	And he said vnto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him, a litle way.
b.2KI.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captiue out of
b.2KI.5.20	But Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath

b.2KI.5.22	And he said, All is well: my master hath sent me, saying, Behold, euen now
b.2KI.5.23	And Naaman said, Bee content, take two talents: and hee vrged him, and bound
b.2KI.5.24	And when he came to the towre, he tooke them from their hand, and bestowed
b.2KI.5.25	But he went in, and stood before his master: and Elisha said vnto him, Whence

b.2KI.5.27	The leprosie therefore of Naaman shall cleaue vnto thee, and vnto thy seede
b.2KI.5.3	And shee saide vnto her mistresse, Would God my lord were with the Prophet
b.2KI.5.4	And one went in, and tolde his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the mayd that
b.2KI.5.5	And the king of Syria said, Goe to, Goe, and I will send a letter vnto the

b.2KI.6.1	And the sonnes of the Prophets saide vnto Elisha, Beholde now, the place where
b.2KI.6.10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God tolde him, and
b.2KI.6.11	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing,
b.2KI.6.12	And one of his seruants sayde, None, my lord O king; but Elisha the Prophet,
b.2KI.6.13	And he said, Goe and spie where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it
b.2KI.6.14	Therefore sent he thither horses, and charets, and a great hoste: and they
b.2KI.6.15	And when the seruant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth,
b.2KI.6.16	And he answered, Feare not: for they that be with vs, are moe then they that
b.2KI.6.17	And Elisha prayed, and sayde, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may

b.2KI.6.19	And Elisha saide vnto them, This is not the way, neither is this the citie:
b.2KI.6.2	Let vs goe, wee pray thee, vnto Iordane, and take thence euery man a beame,
b.2KI.6.20	And it came to passe when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said,
b.2KI.6.21	And the king of Israel saide vnto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall

b.2KI.6.23	And hee prepared great prouision for them, and when they had eaten and drunke,
b.2KI.6.24	And it came to passe after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his
b.2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, vntill
b.2KI.6.26	And as the king of Israel was passing by vpon the wall, there cried a woman
b.2KI.6.27	And he said, If the Lord do not helpe thee, whence shall I helpe thee? out of
b.2KI.6.28	And the king said vnto her, What aileth thee? And shee answered, This woman
b.2KI.6.29	So we boyled my sonne, and did eate him: and I saide vnto her on the next
b.2KI.6.3	And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and goe with thy seruants. And he

b.2KI.6.31	Then he said, God doe so, and more also to mee, if the head of Elisha the
b.2KI.6.32	But Elisha sate in his house (and the elders sate with him) and the king sent
b.2KI.6.33	And while hee yet talked with them, beholde, the messenger came downe vnto
b.2KI.6.4	So hee went with them: and when they came to Iordane, they cut downe wood.
b.2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beame, the axe head fell into the water: and hee
b.2KI.6.6	And the man of God said, Where fell it? and hee shewed him the place: and he
b.2KI.6.7	Therefore said he, Take it vp to thee: And hee put out his hand, and tooke it.
b.2KI.6.8	Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and tooke counsell with his

b.2KI.7.10	So they came, and called vnto the porter of the citie: and they told them,
b.2KI.7.11	And hee called the porters, and they told it to the kings house within.
b.2KI.7.12	And the king arose in the night, and said vnto his seruants, I will now shew

b.2KI.7.18	And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two
b.2KI.7.19	And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now behold, if the Lord
b.2KI.7.2	Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said,
b.2KI.7.20	And so it fell out vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and
b.2KI.7.3	And there were foure leprous men at the entring in of the gate: and they saide
b.2KI.7.4	If we say, We will enter into the citie, then the famine is in the citie, and
b.2KI.7.5	And they rose vp in the twilight, to goe vnto the campe of the Syrians: and
b.2KI.7.6	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to heare a noise of charets, and
b.2KI.7.7	Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their
b.2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the vttermost part of the campe, they went into
b.2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, We doe not well: this day is a day of good
b.2KI.8.1	Then spake Elisha vnto the woman ( whose sonne he had restored to life)
b.2KI.8.10	And Elisha said vnto him, Goe, say vnto him, Thou mayest certeinly recouer:
b.2KI.8.11	And hee setled his countenance stedfastly, vntill he was ashamed: and the man
b.2KI.8.12	And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the

b.2KI.9.10	And the dogges shal eate Iezebel in the portion of Iezreel, and there shal be

b.2SA.11.4	And Dauid sent messengers, and tooke her, and shee came in vnto him, and he
b.2SA.1.15	And Dauid called one of the yong men, and sayd, Goe neere, and fall vpon him.
b.2SA.11.5	And the woman conceiued, and sent and tolde Dauid, and said, I am with childe.
b.2SA.1.16	And Dauid said vnto him, Thy blood be vpon thy head: for thy mouth hath

b.2SA.1.17	And Dauid lamented with this lamentation ouer Saul, and ouer Ionathan his
b.2SA.11.7	And when Uriah was come vnto him, Dauid demanded of him how Ioab did, and how
b.2SA.1.18	(Also hee bade them teach the children of Iudah the vse of the bow: behold,
b.2SA.11.8	And Dauid said to Uriah, Goe downe to thy house, and wash thy feete. And Uriah

b.2SA.12.10	Now therefore the sword shall neuer depart from thine house, because thou
b.2SA.12.11	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise vp euill against thee out of thine
b.2SA.12.12	For thou diddest it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and
b.2SA.12.13	And Dauid saide vnto Nathan, I haue sinned against the Lord. And Nathan saide
b.2SA.12.14	Howbeit, because by this deede thou hast giuen great occasion to the enemies
b.2SA.12.15	And Nathan departed vnto his house: and the Lord strake the childe that
b.2SA.12.16	Dauid therfore besought God for the childe, and Dauid fasted, and went in,
b.2SA.12.17	And the Elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him vp from the

b.2SA.12.2	The rich man had exceeding many flockes and herds.
b.2SA.12.20	Then Dauid arose from the earth and washed, and anointed himselfe, and
b.2SA.12.21	Then said his seruants vnto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou
b.2SA.12.22	And he said, While the child was yet aliue, I fasted and wept: for I said,
b.2SA.12.23	But now hee is dead, Wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him backe againe? I

b.2SA.12.25	And hee sent by the hand of Nathan the Prophet, and hee called his name
b.2SA.12.26	And Ioab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and tooke the royall
b.2SA.12.27	And Ioab sent messengers to Dauid, and said, I haue fought against Rabbah,
b.2SA.12.28	Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together, and encampe against

b.2SA.12.3	But the poore man had nothing saue one litle ewe lambe, which he had bought
b.2SA.12.30	And he tooke their kings crowne from off his head (the weight whereof was a

b.2SA.12.5	And Dauids anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan,
b.2SA.1.26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Ionathan, very pleasant hast thou beene
b.2SA.12.6	And he shall restore the Lambe fourefold, because he did this thing, and
b.2SA.1.27	How are the mightie fallen, and the weapons of warre perished!
b.2SA.12.7	And Nathan said to Dauid, Thou art the man: thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
b.2SA.12.8	And I gaue thee thy Masters house, and thy Masters wiues into thy bosome, and
b.2SA.12.9	Wherefore hast thou despised the commandement of the Lord, to doe euill in his
b.2SA.1.3	And Dauid said vnto him, From whence commest thou? And he said vnto him, Out
b.2SA.13.1	And it came to passe after this, that Absalom the sonne of Dauid had a faire
b.2SA.13.10	And Amnon saide vnto Tamar, Bring the meate into the chamber, that I may eate
b.2SA.13.11	And when shee had brought them vnto him to eate, hee tooke hold of her, and
b.2SA.13.12	And she answered him, Nay, my brother, doe not force me: for no such thing
b.2SA.13.13	And I, whither shall I cause my shame to goe? and as for thee, thou shalt be
b.2SA.13.14	Howbeit hee would not hearken vnto her voice, but being stronger then shee,
b.2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherwith he hated her,
b.2SA.13.16	And she said vnto him, There is no cause: this euill in sending me away, is
b.2SA.13.17	Then hee called his seruant that ministred vnto him, and said, Put now this
b.2SA.13.18	And shee had a garment of diuers colours vpon her: for with such robes were
b.2SA.13.19	And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of diuers colours that
b.2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sicke for his sister Tamar: for she was a
b.2SA.13.20	And Absalom her brother sayde vnto her, Hath Amnon thy brother beene with
b.2SA.13.21	But when King Dauid heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
b.2SA.13.22	And Absalom spake vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom
b.2SA.13.23	And it came to passe after two full yeeres, that Absalom had sheepeshearers
b.2SA.13.24	And Absalom came to the King, and said, Behold now, thy seruant hath
b.2SA.13.25	And the King sayde to Absalom, Nay, my sonne, let vs not all now goe, lest we
b.2SA.13.26	Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon goe with vs. And
b.2SA.13.27	But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the kings sonnes goe with
b.2SA.13.28	Now Absalom had commanded his seruants, saying, Marke yee now when Amnons
b.2SA.13.29	And the seruants of Absalom did vnto Amnon as Absalom had commanded: then all
b.2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Ionadab, the sonne of Shimeah, Dauids
b.2SA.13.30	And it came to passe while they were in the way, that tidings came to Dauid,
b.2SA.13.31	Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth: and all his
b.2SA.13.32	And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother, answered and said, Let not
b.2SA.13.33	Now therefore let not my lord the King take the thing to his heart, to thinke
b.2SA.13.34	But Absalom fled: and the yong man that kept the watch, lift vp his eyes, and
b.2SA.13.35	And Ionadab said vnto the king, Behold, the kings sonnes come: as thy seruant
b.2SA.13.36	And it came to passe assoone as hee had made an ende of speaking, that
b.2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the sonne of Ammihud king of Geshur: and
b.2SA.13.38	So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three yeeres.
b.2SA.13.39	And the soule of king Dauid longed to goe foorth vnto Absalom: for he was
b.2SA.13.4	And he saide vnto him, Why art thou, being the Kings sonne, leane from day to
b.2SA.13.5	And Ionadab said vnto him, Lay thee downe on thy bed, and make thy selfe sicke:
b.2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay downe, and made himselfe sicke: and when the king was come to see
b.2SA.13.7	Then Dauid sent home to Tamar, saying, Goe now to thy brother Amnons house,
b.2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house (and hee was laide downe) and she
b.2SA.13.9	And she tooke a pan, and powred them out before him, but hee refused to eate:
b.2SA.1.4	And Dauid said vnto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell mee. And he
b.2SA.14.1	Now Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, perceiued that the kings heart was toward
b.2SA.14.10	And the king said, Whosoeuer saith ought vnto thee, bring him to mee, and he
b.2SA.14.11	Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the Lord thy God, that thou

b.2SA.14.14	For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot bee
b.2SA.14.15	Now therefore that I am come to speake of this thing vnto my lord the king,
b.2SA.14.16	For the king wil heare, to deliuer his handmayd out of the hand of the man
b.2SA.14.17	Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be
b.2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said vnto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray
b.2SA.14.19	And the king said, Is not the hand of Ioab with thee in all this? And the
b.2SA.14.2	And Ioab sent to Tekoah, and fetcht thence a wise woman, and said vnto her, I
b.2SA.14.20	To fetch about this forme of speech hath thy seruant Ioab done this thing:
b.2SA.14.21	And the king said vnto Ioab, Behold now, I haue done this thing: goe
b.2SA.14.22	And Ioab fell to the ground on his face, &amp; bowed himselfe, and thanked
b.2SA.14.23	So Ioab arose, and went to Geshur, &amp; brought Absalom to Ierusalem.
b.2SA.14.24	And the king said, Let him turne to his owne house, &amp; let him not see my
b.2SA.14.25	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom, for his
b.2SA.14.26	And when he polled his head, (for it was at euery yeres end that he polled
b.2SA.14.27	And vnto Absalom there were borne three sonnes, and one daughter, whose name
b.2SA.14.28	So Absalom dwelt two full yeeres in Ierusalem, and saw not the kings face.
b.2SA.14.29	Therefore Absalom sent for Ioab, to haue sent him to the king, but hee would
b.2SA.14.3	And come to the king, and speake on this maner vnto him: so Ioab put the words
b.2SA.14.30	Therefore hee said vnto his seruants, See, Ioabs field is neere mine, and he
b.2SA.14.31	Then Ioab arose, and came to Absalom vnto his house, and said vnto him,
b.2SA.14.32	And Absalom answered Ioab, Behold, I sent vnto thee, saying, come hither,
b.2SA.14.33	So Ioab came to the King, and told him: and when hee had called for Absalom,
b.2SA.14.4	And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, shee fell on her face to the
b.2SA.14.5	And the king said vnto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a
b.2SA.14.6	And thy handmayd had two sonnes, and they two stroue together in the field,
b.2SA.14.7	And behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmayd, and they said,
b.2SA.14.8	And the king saide vnto the woman, Goe to thine house, and I will giue charge
b.2SA.14.9	And the woman of Tekoah said vnto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquitie bee

b.2SA.15.1	And it came to passe after this, that Absalom prepared him charets and horses,
b.2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies thorowout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soone
b.2SA.15.11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Ierusalem, that were called, and
b.2SA.15.12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Dauids counseller, from his
b.2SA.15.13	And there came a messenger to Dauid, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel
b.2SA.15.14	And Dauid said vnto all his seruants that were with him at Ierusalem, Arise,
b.2SA.15.15	And the kings seruants said vnto the king, Behold, thy seruants are readie to
b.2SA.15.16	And the king went foorth, and all his houshold after him: and the King left
b.2SA.15.17	And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and taried in a place
b.2SA.15.18	And all his seruants passed on beside him: and all the Cherethites, and all
b.2SA.15.19	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with vs?
b.2SA.15.2	And Absalom rose vp earely, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was
b.2SA.15.20	Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee goe vp and
b.2SA.15.21	And Ittai answered the King, and said, As the Lord liueth, and as my lord the
b.2SA.15.22	And Dauid said to Ittai, Goe, and passe ouer. And Ittai the Gittite passed
b.2SA.15.23	And all the countrey wept with a loude voice, and all the people passed ouer:
b.2SA.15.24	And loe, Zadok also, and all the Leuites were with him, bearing the Arke of

b.2SA.15.27	The king said also vnto Zadok the Priest, Art not thou a Seer? Returne into
b.2SA.15.28	See, I will tarie in the plaine of the wildernesse, vntill there come word
b.2SA.15.29	Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem; and
b.2SA.15.3	And Absalom said vnto him, See, thy matters are good &amp; right, but there is
b.2SA.15.30	And Dauid went vp by the ascent of mount Oliuet, and wept as he went vp, and
b.2SA.15.31	And one tolde Dauid, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with
b.2SA.15.32	And it came to passe, that when Dauid was come to the top of the mount, where
b.2SA.15.33	Unto whom Dauid said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden
b.2SA.15.34	But if thou returne to the citie, and say vnto Absalom, I wil be thy seruant,
b.2SA.15.35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok, and Abiathar the Priests? therefore
b.2SA.15.36	Behold, they haue there with them their two sonnes, Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne, and
b.2SA.15.37	So Hushai Dauids friend came into the citie, and Absalom came into Ierusalem.
b.2SA.15.4	Absalom said moreouer, Oh that I were made Iudge in the land, that euery man
b.2SA.15.5	And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him, to doe him obeisance, he
b.2SA.15.6	And on this maner did Absalom to all Israel, that came to the King for
b.2SA.15.7	And it came to passe after fourtie yeeres, that Absalom said vnto the king, I
b.2SA.15.8	For thy seruant vowed a vowe while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the
b.2SA.15.9	And the king said vnto him, Goe in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
b.2SA.1.6	And the yong man that told him, said, As I happened by chance vpon mount
b.2SA.16.1	And when Dauid was a little past the top of the hill, Beholde, Ziba the
b.2SA.16.10	And the king said, What haue I to doe with you, ye sonnes of Zeruiah? So let
b.2SA.16.11	And Dauid said to Abishai, and to all his seruants, Beholde, my sonne which
b.2SA.16.12	It may bee that the Lord will looke on mine affliction, and that the Lord
b.2SA.16.13	And as Dauid and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hilles
b.2SA.16.14	And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and
b.2SA.16.15	And Absalom and al the people the men of Israel, came to Ierusalem, and
b.2SA.16.16	And it came to passe when Hushai the Archite, Dauids friend, was come vnto
b.2SA.16.17	And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindnesse to thy friend? Why wentest
b.2SA.16.18	And Hushai said vnto Absalom, Nay, but whom the Lord and this people, and all
b.2SA.16.19	And againe, whom should I serue? should I not serue in the presence of his
b.2SA.16.2	And the King saide vnto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba saide, The
b.2SA.16.20	Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Giue counsell among you what we shall doe.
b.2SA.16.21	And Ahithophel said vnto Absalom, Goe in vnto thy fathers concubines, which
b.2SA.16.22	So they spread Absalom a tent vpon the top of the house, and Absalom went in
b.2SA.16.23	And the counsell of Ahithophel which he counselled in those dayes, was as if
b.2SA.16.3	And the king said, And where is thy masters sonne? and Ziba said vnto the
b.2SA.16.4	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained vnto
b.2SA.16.5	And when king Dauid came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the
b.2SA.16.6	And he cast stones at Dauid, and at all the seruants of king Dauid: and all
b.2SA.16.7	And thus said Shimei when hee cursed, Come out, come out thou bloody man, and
b.2SA.16.8	The Lord hath returned vpon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose
b.2SA.16.9	Then said Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah vnto the king, Why should this dead
b.2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called vnto mee: and I answered,
b.2SA.17.1	Moreouer Ahithophel said vnto Absalom, Let mee nowe chuse out twelue thousand
b.2SA.17.10	And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a Lyon, shall
b.2SA.17.11	Therefore I counsell, that all Israel be generally gathered vnto thee, from
b.2SA.17.12	So shall wee come vpon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will
b.2SA.17.13	Moreouer, if hee be gotten into a citie, then shall all Israel bring ropes to
b.2SA.17.14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsell of Hushai the
b.2SA.17.15	Then said Hushai vnto Zadok and to Abiathar the Priestes, Thus and thus did
b.2SA.17.16	Now therefore send quickly, and tell Dauid, saying, Lodge not this night in
b.2SA.17.17	Now Ionathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel: (for they might not be seene to
b.2SA.17.18	Neuerthelesse, a ladde saw them, and tolde Absalom: but they went both of
b.2SA.17.19	And the woman tooke and spread a couering ouer the welles mouth, and spread
b.2SA.17.2	And I wil come vpon him while hee is wearie and weake handed, and wil make him
b.2SA.17.20	And when Absaloms seruants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where
b.2SA.17.21	And it came to passe after they were departed, that they came vp out of the
b.2SA.17.22	Then Dauid arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed ouer
b.2SA.17.23	And when Ahithophel sawe that his counsell was not followed, he sadled his
b.2SA.17.24	Then Dauid came to Mahanaim: and Absalom passed ouer Iordane, he and all the
b.2SA.17.25	And Absalom made Amasa captaine of the hoste in stead of Ioab: which Amasa
b.2SA.17.26	So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
b.2SA.17.27	And it came to passe when Dauid was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the sonne of
b.2SA.17.28	Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and
b.2SA.17.29	And honie, and butter, and sheepe, and cheese of kine for Dauid, and for the
b.2SA.17.3	And I wil bring backe all the people vnto thee: the man whom thou seekest is
b.2SA.17.4	And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the Elders of Israel.
b.2SA.17.5	Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let vs heare likewise
b.2SA.17.6	And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake vnto him, saying,
b.2SA.17.7	And Hushai said vnto Absalom, The counsell that Ahithophel hath giuen, is not
b.2SA.17.8	For, (said Hushai,) thou knowest thy father and his men, that they bee mightie
b.2SA.17.9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it wil come to
b.2SA.1.8	And hee said vnto mee, Who art thou? and I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
b.2SA.18.1	And Dauid numbred the people that were with him, and set captaines of
b.2SA.18.10	And a certaine man saw it, and told Ioab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom
b.2SA.18.11	And Ioab said vnto the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest him, and
b.2SA.18.12	And the man saide vnto Ioab, Though I should receiue a thousand shekels of
b.2SA.18.13	Otherwyse, I should haue wrought falshood against mine owne life: for there
b.2SA.18.14	Then said Ioab, I may not tary thus with thee. And hee tooke three darts in
b.2SA.18.15	And ten yong men that bare Ioabs armour, compassed about and smote Absalom,
b.2SA.18.16	And Ioab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after
b.2SA.18.17	And they tooke Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and layd a
b.2SA.18.18	Now Absalom in his life time had taken and reared vp for himselfe a pillar,
b.2SA.18.19	Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok, Let mee now runne, and beare the King
b.2SA.18.2	And Dauid sent forth a third part of the people vnder the hand of Ioab, and a
b.2SA.18.20	And Ioab said vnto him, Thou shalt not beare tidings this day, but thou shalt
b.2SA.18.21	Then said Ioab to Cushi, Goe tell the King what thou hast seene. And Cushi
b.2SA.18.22	Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok yet againe to Ioab, But howsoeuer, let
b.2SA.18.23	But howsoeuer, (said he) let mee runne: And hee said vnto him, Runne. Then
b.2SA.18.24	And Dauid sate betweene the two gates: and the watchman went vp to the roofe
b.2SA.18.25	And the watchman cried, and told the King. And the king said, If he bee
b.2SA.18.26	And the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called vnto the
b.2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, Mee thinketh the running of the foremost is like the
b.2SA.18.28	And Ahimaaz called, and said vnto the King, All is well. And hee fell downe
b.2SA.18.29	And the king said, Is the yong man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When
b.2SA.18.3	But the people answered, Thou shalt not goe foorth: for if we flee away, they
b.2SA.18.30	And the king said vnto him, Turne aside and stand here. And hee turned aside,
b.2SA.18.31	And behold, Cushi came, and Cushi said, Tidings my lord the king: for the
b.2SA.18.32	And the king said vnto Cushi, Is the yong man Absalom safe? And Cushi
b.2SA.18.33	And the king was much moued, and went vp to the chamber ouer the gate, and
b.2SA.18.4	And the King sayde vnto them, What seemeth you best, I will doe. And the King
b.2SA.18.5	And the king commanded Ioab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Deale gently for
b.2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battell was in
b.2SA.18.7	Where the people of Israel were slaine before the seruants of Dauid, and there
b.2SA.18.8	For the battell was there scattered ouer the face of all the countrey: and the
b.2SA.18.9	And Absalom met the seruants of Dauid; and Absalom rode vpon a mule, and the
b.2SA.1.9	He said vnto me againe, Stand, I pray thee, vpon me, and slay me: for anguish
b.2SA.19.1	And it was told Ioab, Beholde, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
b.2SA.19.10	And Absalom whom wee anointed ouer vs, is dead in battell: nowe therefore why
b.2SA.19.11	And King Dauid sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speake vnto
b.2SA.19.12	Yee are my brethren, Yee are my bones and my flesh: wherfore then are ye the
b.2SA.19.13	And say ye to Amasa: Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to
b.2SA.19.14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Iudah, euen as the heart of one man,
b.2SA.19.15	So the King returned, and came to Iordan: and Iudah came to Gilgal, to goe to
b.2SA.19.16	And Shimei the sonne of Gera, a Beniamite, which wass of Bahurim, hasted,
b.2SA.19.17	And there were a thousand men of Beniamin with him, and Ziba the seruant of
b.2SA.19.18	And there went ouer a ferry-boat to cary ouer the kings houshold, and to doe
b.2SA.19.19	And said vnto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquitie vnto me, neither do
b.2SA.19.2	And the victorie that day was turned into mourning vnto all the people: for
b.2SA.19.20	For thy seruant doeth know that I haue sinned: therefore behold, I am come
b.2SA.19.21	But Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah answered, and sayd, Shall not Shimei be put
b.2SA.19.22	And Dauid said, What haue I to doe with you, yee sonnes of Zeruiah, that yee
b.2SA.19.23	Therfore the king said vnto Shimei, Thou shalt not die: and the King sware
b.2SA.19.24	And Mephibosheth the sonne of Saul came downe to meet the king, and had
b.2SA.19.25	And it came to passe when he was come to Ierusalem to meete the King, that
b.2SA.19.26	And hee answered, My lord O king, my seruant deceiued mee; for thy seruant
b.2SA.19.27	And hee hath slandered thy seruant vnto my lord the king, but my lord the
b.2SA.19.28	For all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet
b.2SA.19.29	And the king said vnto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I haue
b.2SA.19.3	And the people gate them by stealth that day into the citie, as people beeing
b.2SA.19.30	And Mephibosheth said vnto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my
b.2SA.19.31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came downe from Rogelim, and went ouer Iordane
b.2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, euen fourescore yeeres olde, and he had
b.2SA.19.33	And the king said vnto Barzillai, Come thou ouer with me, and I will feede
b.2SA.19.34	And Barzillai sayde vnto the king, How long haue I to liue, that I should goe
b.2SA.19.35	I am this day fourescore yeeres olde: and can I discerne betweene good and
b.2SA.19.36	Thy seruant will goe a little way ouer Iordane with the king: and why should
b.2SA.19.37	Let thy seruant, I pray thee, turne backe againe, that I may die in mine owne
b.2SA.19.38	And the king answered, Chimham shal goe ouer with me, and I will doe to him
b.2SA.19.39	And all the people went ouer Iordane: and when the king was come ouer, the
b.2SA.19.4	But the king couered his face, and the king cried with a loud voyce, O my
b.2SA.19.40	Then the King went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the
b.2SA.19.41	And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said vnto the king,
b.2SA.19.42	And all the men of Iudah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is
b.2SA.19.43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Iudah, and said, Wee haue ten parts
b.2SA.19.5	And Ioab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day
b.2SA.19.6	In that thou louest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends; for thou hast
b.2SA.19.7	Now therefore arise, goe foorth, and speake comfortably vnto thy seruants: for
b.2SA.19.8	Then the King rose, and sate in the gate: and they told vnto all the people,
b.2SA.19.9	And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying,
b.2SA.20.1	And there happened to bee there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba the
b.2SA.20.10	But Amasa tooke no heed to the sword that was in Ioabs hand: so hee smote him
b.2SA.20.11	And one of Ioabs men stood by him, and said, He that fauoureth Ioab, and hee
b.2SA.20.12	And Amasa wallowed in blood in the mids of the high way: and when the man saw
b.2SA.20.13	When he was remoued out of the high way, all the people went on after Ioab,
b.2SA.20.14	And hee went thorow all the tribes of Israel vnto Abel, and to Bethmaachah,
b.2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast vp a
b.2SA.20.16	Then cried a wise woman out of the citie, Heare, heare; say, I pray you, vnto
b.2SA.20.17	And when he was come neere vnto her, the woman said, Art thou Ioab? And he
b.2SA.20.18	Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speake in old time, saying, They
b.2SA.20.19	I am one of them that are peaceable and faithfull in Israel: thou seekest to
b.2SA.20.2	So euery man of Israel went vp from after Dauid, and followed Sheba the sonne
b.2SA.20.20	And Ioab answered and saide, Farre be it, farre be it from me, that I should
b.2SA.20.21	The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim (Sheba the sonne of Bichri
b.2SA.20.22	Then the woman went vnto all the people in her wisedome, and they cut off the
b.2SA.20.23	Now Ioab was ouer all the hoste of Israel, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada
b.2SA.20.24	And Adoram was ouer the tribute, and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud was
b.2SA.20.25	And Sheua was scribe, and Zadok, and Abiathar were the Priests.
b.2SA.20.26	And Ira also the Iairite, was a chiefe ruler about Dauid.
b.2SA.20.3	And Dauid came to his house at Ierusalem, and the king tooke the ten women his
b.2SA.20.4	Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Iudah within three dayes,
b.2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Iudah; but hee taried longer then the set
b.2SA.20.6	And Dauid said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the sonne of Bichri doe vs more
b.2SA.20.7	And there went out after him Ioabs men, and the Cherethites, and the
b.2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them:
b.2SA.20.9	And Ioab saide to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Ioab tooke Amasa
b.2SA.2.1	And it came to passe after this, that Dauid enquired of the Lord, saying,
b.2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth Sauls sonne was fortie yeeres olde when he began to reigne ouer
b.2SA.2.11	(And the time that Dauid was King in Hebron ouer the house of Iudah, was
b.2SA.21.1	Then there was a famine in the dayes of Dauid three yeeres, yeere after yeere,
b.2SA.21.10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah tooke sackecloth, and spread it for her vpon
b.2SA.21.11	And it was tolde Dauid what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul
b.2SA.21.12	And Dauid went and tooke the bones of Saul, and the bones of Ionathan his
b.2SA.21.13	And hee brought vp from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Ionathan
b.2SA.21.14	And the bones of Saul and Ionathan his sonne buried they in the countrey of
b.2SA.21.15	Moreouer, the Philistines had yet warre againe with Israel, and Dauid went
b.2SA.21.16	And Ishbi-benob which was of the sonnes of the gyant, (the weight of whose
b.2SA.21.17	But Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and
b.2SA.21.18	And it came to passe after this, that there was againe a battell with the
b.2SA.21.19	And there was againe a battell in Gob, with the Philistines, where Elhanan
b.2SA.2.12	And Abner the sonne of Ner, and the seruants of Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul,
b.2SA.21.2	And the king called the Gibeonites, and said vnto them, (now the Gibeonites
b.2SA.21.20	And there was yet a battell in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that
b.2SA.21.21	And when he defied Israel, Ionathan the sonne of Shimea the brother of Dauid,
b.2SA.21.22	These foure were borne to the Gyant in Gath, and fell by the hand of Dauid,
b.2SA.2.13	And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and the seruants of Dauid went out, and met
b.2SA.21.3	Wherefore Dauid said vnto the Gibeonites, What shall I doe for you? and
b.2SA.2.14	And Abner said to Ioab, Let the yong men now arise, and play before vs: and
b.2SA.21.4	And the Gibeonites saide vnto him, We will haue no siluer nor golde of Saul,
b.2SA.2.15	Then there arose and went ouer by number twelue of Beniamin, which pertained
b.2SA.21.5	And they answered the king, The man that consumed vs, and that deuised against
b.2SA.2.16	And they caught euery one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his
b.2SA.21.6	Let seuen men of his sonnes bee deliuered vnto vs, and wee will hang them vp
b.2SA.2.17	And there was a very sore battell that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men
b.2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul,
b.2SA.2.18	And there were three sonnes of Zeruiah there, Ioab, and Abishai, and Asahel:
b.2SA.21.8	But the king tooke the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare
b.2SA.2.19	And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he turned not to the right hand
b.2SA.21.9	And hee deliuered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them
b.2SA.2.2	So Dauid went vp thither, and his two wiues also, Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse,
b.2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I
b.2SA.2.21	And Abner said to him, Turne thee aside to thy right hand, or to thy left,
b.2SA.22.1	And Dauid spake vnto the Lord the wordes of this song, in the day that the
b.2SA.22.10	Hee bowed the heauens also and came downe: and darkenesse was vnder his feete.
b.2SA.22.11	And he rode vpon a Cherub, and did flie: and hee was seene vpon the wings of
b.2SA.22.12	And hee made darkenesse pauilions round about him, darke waters, and thicke
b.2SA.22.13	Through the brightnesse before him, were coales of fire kindled.
b.2SA.22.14	The Lord thundred from heauen: and the most high vttered his voice.
b.2SA.22.15	And he sent out arrowes, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
b.2SA.22.16	And the channels of the Sea appeared, the foundations of the world were
b.2SA.22.17	He sent from aboue, he tooke me: he drew me out of many waters.
b.2SA.22.18	He deliuered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated mee: for they
b.2SA.22.19	They preuented me in the day of my calamitie: but the Lord was my stay.
b.2SA.2.22	And Abner said againe to Asahel, Turne thee aside from following me:
b.2SA.22.2	And he said, The Lord is my rocke and my fortresse, and my deliuerer:
b.2SA.22.20	Hee brought me forth also into a large place: he deliuered me, because hee
b.2SA.22.21	The Lord rewarded mee according to my righteousnesse: according to the
b.2SA.22.22	For I haue kept the wayes of the Lord, and haue not wickedly departed from my
b.2SA.22.23	For all his iudgements were before me: and as for his Statutes, I did not
b.2SA.22.24	I was also vpright before him: and haue kept my selfe from mine iniquitie.
b.2SA.22.25	Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me, according to my righteousnesse:
b.2SA.22.26	With the merciful thou wilt shew thy selfe mercifull, and with the vpright
b.2SA.22.27	With the pure thou wilt shew thy selfe pure: and with the froward, thou wilt
b.2SA.22.28	And the afflicted people thou wilt saue: but thine eyes are vpon the hautie,
b.2SA.22.29	For thou art my lampe, O Lord: and the Lord wil lighten my darkenesse.
b.2SA.2.23	Howbeit he refused to turne aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder ende of
b.2SA.22.3	The God of my rocke, in him will I trust: hee is my shield, and the horne of
b.2SA.22.30	For by thee I haue run through a troupe: by my God haue I leaped ouer a wall.
b.2SA.22.31	As for God, his way is perfect, the word of the Lord is tried: he is a
b.2SA.22.32	For who is God, saue the Lord ? and who is a rocke, saue our God?
b.2SA.22.33	God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
b.2SA.22.34	Hee maketh my feet like hindes feet: and setteth mee vpon my high places.
b.2SA.22.35	He teacheth my hands to warre: so that a bow of steele is broken by mine
b.2SA.22.36	Thou hast also giuen mee the shield of thy saluation: and thy gentlenesse
b.2SA.22.37	Thou hast enlarged my steps vnder me: so that my feet did not slip.
b.2SA.22.38	I haue pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them: and turned not againe vntill
b.2SA.22.39	And I haue consumed them and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea,
b.2SA.2.24	Ioab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the Sunne went downe when they
b.2SA.22.4	I will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saued from
b.2SA.22.40	For thou hast girded mee with strength to battel: them that rose vp against
b.2SA.22.41	Thou hast also giuen mee the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them
b.2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was none to saue: euen vnto the Lord, but he answered
b.2SA.22.43	Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I did stampe them as
b.2SA.22.44	Thou also hast deliuered mee from the striuings of my people, thou hast kept

b.2SA.3.21	And Abner said vnto Dauid, I will arise, and goe, and will gather all Israel
b.2SA.3.22	And behold, the seruants of Dauid, and Ioab came from pursuing a troupe, and
b.2SA.3.23	When Ioab and all the host that was with him, were come, they told Ioab,
b.2SA.3.24	Then Ioab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came
b.2SA.3.25	Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner, that he came to deceiue thee, and to

b.2SA.3.33	And the king lamented ouer Abner, and said, Died Abner as a foole dieth?
b.2SA.3.34	Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feete put into fetters: as a man falleth
b.2SA.3.35	And when all the people came to cause Dauid to eate meate while it was yet
b.2SA.3.36	And all the people tooke notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoeuer the
b.2SA.3.37	For all the people, and all Israel vnderstood that day, that it was not of

b.2SA.3.7	And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and
b.2SA.3.8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dogs
b.2SA.3.9	So doe God to Abner, and more also, except, as the Lord hath sworne to Dauid,
b.2SA.4.1	And when Sauls sonne heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were
b.2SA.4.10	When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, ( thinking to haue brought
b.2SA.4.11	How much more, when wicked men haue slaine a righteous person, in his owne
b.2SA.4.12	And Dauid commanded his yong men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands
b.2SA.4.2	And Sauls sonne had two men that were captaines of bands: the name of the one
b.2SA.4.3	And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were soiourners there vntill this
b.2SA.4.4	And Ionathan, Sauls sonne, had a sonne that was lame of his feete, and was
b.2SA.4.5	And the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came

b.2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth vnto Dauid to Hebron, and said to the
b.2SA.4.9	And Dauid answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sonnes of Rimmon the
b.2SA.5.1	Then came all the tribes of Israel to Dauid vnto Hebron, and spake, saying,
b.2SA.5.10	And Dauid went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.
b.2SA.5.11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid, and Cedar trees, and
b.2SA.5.12	And Dauid perceiued that the Lord had established him King ouer Israel, and
b.2SA.5.13	And Dauid tooke him mo concubines and wiues out of Ierusalem, after he was

b.2SA.5.16	And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
b.2SA.5.17	But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed Dauid King ouer Israel,
b.2SA.5.18	The Philistines also came, and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim.
b.2SA.5.19	And Dauid enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I goe vp to the Philistines?
b.2SA.5.2	Also in time past when Saul was king ouer vs, thou wast hee that leddest out
b.2SA.5.20	And Dauid came to Baal-Perazim, and Dauid smote them there, and said, The
b.2SA.5.21	And there they left their images, and Dauid and his men burnt them.
b.2SA.5.22	And the Philistines came vp yet againe, and spread themselues in the valley
b.2SA.5.23	And when Dauid enquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not goe vp: but
b.2SA.5.24	And let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the
b.2SA.5.25	And Dauid did so, as the Lord had commaunded him; and smote the Philistines
b.2SA.5.3	So all the Elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron, and King Dauid made a

b.2SA.5.7	Neuerthelesse, Dauid tooke the strong hold of Zion: the same is the citie of
b.2SA.5.8	And Dauid said on that day, Whosoeuer getteth vp to the gutter, and smiteth
b.2SA.5.9	So Dauid dwelt in the fort, and called it the citie of Dauid, and Dauid built
b.2SA.6.1	Againe, Dauid gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirtie
b.2SA.6.10	So Dauid would not remoue the Arke of the Lord vnto him into the citie of
b.2SA.6.11	And the Arke of the Lord continued in the house of Obed Edom the Gittite,
b.2SA.6.12	And it was told king Dauid, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house of Obed
b.2SA.6.13	And it was so, that when they that bare the Arke of the Lord, had gone sixe
b.2SA.6.14	And Dauid daunced before the Lord with all his might, and Dauid was girded
b.2SA.6.15	So Dauid and all the house of Israel brought vp the Arke of the Lord with
b.2SA.6.16	And as the Arke of the Lord came into the citie of Dauid, Michal Sauls

b.2SA.6.19	And hee dealt among all the people, euen among the whole multitude of Israel,
b.2SA.6.2	And Dauid arose and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale of
b.2SA.6.20	Then Dauid returned to blesse his houshold: and Michal the daughter of Saul
b.2SA.6.21	And Dauid said vnto Michal, It was before the Lord, which chose me before thy
b.2SA.6.22	And I will yet be more vile then thus, and will be base in mine owne sight:
b.2SA.6.23	Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no childe vnto the day of her
b.2SA.6.3	And they set the Arke of God vpon a new cart, and brought it out of the house
b.2SA.6.4	And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah,
b.2SA.6.5	And Dauid and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of
b.2SA.6.6	And when they came to Nachons threshing floore, Uzzah put forth his hand to
b.2SA.6.7	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there
b.2SA.6.8	And Dauid was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach vpon Uzzah: And
b.2SA.6.9	And Dauid was afraide of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the Arke of

b.2SA.7.10	(Moreouer I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
b.2SA.7.11	And as since the time that I commanded Iudges to bee ouer my people Israel,

b.2SA.7.17	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan
b.2SA.7.18	Then went king Dauid in, and sate before the Lord, and hee said, Who am I, O
b.2SA.7.19	And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God: but thou hast spoken
b.2SA.7.2	That the king said vnto Nathan the Prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of
b.2SA.7.20	And what can Dauid say more vnto thee? for thou, Lord God, knowest thy
b.2SA.7.21	For thy words sake, and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these
b.2SA.7.22	Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither is
b.2SA.7.23	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, euen like Israel, whom
b.2SA.7.24	For thou hast confirmed to thy selfe thy people Israel to be a people vnto

b.2SA.7.26	And let thy name bee magnified for euer, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God
b.2SA.7.27	For thou, O Lord of hostes, God of Israel, hast reuealed to thy seruant,
b.2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord GOD, (thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast
b.2SA.7.29	Therefore now let it please thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it
b.2SA.7.3	And Nathan sayde to the King, Go, doe all that is in thine heart: for the Lord
b.2SA.7.4	And it came to passe that night, that the word of the Lord came vnto Nathan,
b.2SA.7.5	Goe and tell my seruant Dauid, Thus sayth the Lord, Shalt thou build me an
b.2SA.7.6	Whereas I haue not dwelt in any house, since the time that I brought vp the
b.2SA.7.7	In all the places wherein I haue walked with all the children of Israel, spake
b.2SA.7.8	Now therefore so shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid; Thus sayth the Lord of

b.2SA.8.10	Then Toi sent Ioram his sonne vnto king Dauid to salute him, and to blesse
b.2SA.8.11	Which also king Dauid did dedicate vnto the Lord, with the siluer and gold
b.2SA.8.12	Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines,
b.2SA.8.13	And Dauid gate him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the
b.2SA.8.14	And he put garrisons in Edom; thorowout all Edom put he garrisons, and all
b.2SA.8.15	And Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and Dauid executed iudgement and iustice
b.2SA.8.16	And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the host, and Iehoshaphat the sonne of

b.2SA.8.18	And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer both the Cherethites, and the
b.2SA.8.2	And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them downe to the
b.2SA.8.3	Dauid smote also Hadadezer the sonne of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to
b.2SA.8.4	And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen hundred horsemen, and
b.2SA.8.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah,
b.2SA.8.6	Then Dauid put garisons in Syria of Damascus: And the Syrians became seruants
b.2SA.8.7	And Dauid tooke the shields of gold that were on the seruants of Hadadezer,
b.2SA.8.8	And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King Dauid tooke
b.2SA.8.9	When Toi king of Hamath heard that Dauid had smitten all the hoste of

b.2SA.9.3	And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew
b.2SA.9.4	And the king saide vnto him, Where is hee? and Ziba said vnto the king,
b.2SA.9.5	Then king Dauid sent, and fet him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel,
b.2SA.9.6	Now when Mephibosheth the sonne of Ionathan the sonne of Saul, was come vnto
b.2SA.9.7	And Dauid saide vnto him, Feare not; for I will surely shew thee kindnesse,
b.2SA.9.8	And hee bowed himselfe, and saide, What is thy seruant, that thou shouldest
b.2SA.9.9	Then the king called to Ziba Sauls seruant, and said vnto him, I haue giuen
b.2TH.1.1	Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of

b.2TH.3.12	Yea, and all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution.
b.2TH.3.13	But euill men and seducers shall waxe worse and worse, deceiuing, and being

b.2TH.3.2	And that we may bee deliuered from vnreasonable and wicked men: for all men
b.2TH.3.2	For men shall bee louers of their owne selues, couetous, boasters, proude,
b.2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithfull, who shall stablish you, and keepe you from euill.

b.2TH.3.7	Euer learning, and neuer able to come to the knowledge of the trueth.
b.2TH.3.7	For your selues know how yee ought to follow vs: for wee behaued not our

b.2TH.3.8	Now as Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the trueth:
b.2TH.3.9	But they shal proceede no further: for their folly shall be manifest vnto all
b.2TH.3.9	Not because we haue not power, but to make our selues an ensample vnto you to
b.2TH.4.1	I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall iudge

b.2TH.4.14	Alexander the Coppersmith did mee much euill, the Lord reward him according to
b.2TH.4.15	Of whom bee thou ware also, for he hath greatly withstood our words.
b.2TH.4.16	At my first answere no man stood with me, and strengthened me, that by me the

b.2TH.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their

b.2TH.4.5	But watch thou in all things, indure afflictions, doe the worke of an Euangelist,
b.2TH.4.6	For I am now readie to bee offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
b.2TH.4.7	I haue fought a good fight, I haue finished my course, I haue kept the faith.
b.2TH.4.8	Hencefoorth there is layde vp for me a crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord
b.2TH.4.9	Doe thy diligence to come shorly vnto me:
b.3JO.1.1	The Elder vnto the welbeloued Gaius, whom I loue in the trueth:
b.3JO.1.10	Wherefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating
b.3JO.1.11	Beloued, follow not that which is euill, but that which is good. He that doth
b.3JO.1.12	Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the trueth it selfe: yea, and
b.3JO.1.13	I had many things to write, but I will not with inke and pen write vnto thee.
b.3JO.1.14	But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and wee shall speake face to face.
b.3JO.1.2	Beloued, I wish aboue all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health,
b.3JO.1.3	For I reioyced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that
b.3JO.1.4	I haue no greater ioy, then to heare that my children walke in truth.
b.3JO.1.5	Beloued, thou doest faithfully whatsoeuer thou doest to the Brethren, and to
b.3JO.1.6	Which haue borne witnesse of thy charitie before the Church: whome if thou

b.ACT.10.1	There was a certaine man in Cesarea, called Cornelius, a Centurion of ye band
b.ACT.10.10	And he became very hungry, and would haue eaten: But while they made ready,
b.ACT.10.11	And saw heauen opened, and a certaine vessell descending vnto him, as it had
b.ACT.10.12	Wherein were all maner of foure footed beasts of the earth, and wilde beasts,
b.ACT.10.13	And there came a voyce to him, Rise, Peter: kill, and eate.
b.ACT.10.14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I haue neuer eaten any thing that is common
b.ACT.10.15	And the voice spake vnto him againe the second time, What God hath cleansed,
b.ACT.10.16	This was done thrise: &amp; the vessel was receiued vp againe into heauen.
b.ACT.10.17	Now while Peter doubted in himselfe what this vision which he had seene,
b.ACT.10.18	And called, and asked whether Simon, which was sirnamed Peter, were lodged
b.ACT.10.19	While Peter thought on the vision, the spirit said vnto him, Behold, three
b.ACT.10.2	A deuout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gaue much
b.ACT.10.20	Arise therefore, and get thee downe, and goe with them, doubting nothing: for
b.ACT.10.21	Then Peter went downe to the men, which were sent vnto him from Cornelius,
b.ACT.10.22	And they saide, Cornelius the Centurion, a iust man, and one that feareth
b.ACT.10.23	Then called he them in, and lodged them: And on the morrowe Peter went away
b.ACT.10.24	And the morrow after they entred into Cesarea: and Cornelius waited for them,
b.ACT.10.25	And as Peter was comming in, Cornelius met him, and fell downe at his feete,
b.ACT.10.26	But Peter tooke him vp, saying, Stand vp, I my selfe also am a man.
b.ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, hee went in, and found many that were come
b.ACT.10.28	And he said vnto them, Ye know how that it is an vnlawfull thing for a man
b.ACT.10.29	Therfore came I vnto you without gainesaying, as soone as I was sent for. I
b.ACT.10.3	He saw in a vision euidently, about the ninth houre of the day, an Angel of
b.ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, Foure daies agoe I was fasting vntill this houre, and at
b.ACT.10.31	And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine almes are had in
b.ACT.10.32	Send therfore to Ioppa, and call hither Simon, whose sirname is Peter; he is
b.ACT.10.33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast well done, that thou art
b.ACT.10.34	Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a trueth I perceiue that God is no
b.ACT.10.35	But in euery nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousnesse, is
b.ACT.10.36	The word which God sent vnto the children of
b.ACT.10.37	That word (I say) you knowe which was published thorowout all Iudea, and
b.ACT.10.38	How God anointed Iesus of Nazareth with the holy Ghost, and with power, who
b.ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all things which hee did both in the land of the
b.ACT.10.4	And when he looked on him, hee was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he
b.ACT.10.40	Him God raised vp the third day, and shewed him openly,
b.ACT.10.41	Not to all the people, but vnto witnesses, chosen before of God, euen to vs
b.ACT.10.42	And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie that it is he
b.ACT.10.43	To him giue all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name whosoeuer
b.ACT.10.44	While Peter yet spake these words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which
b.ACT.10.45	And they of the circumcision which beleeued, were astonished, as many as came
b.ACT.10.46	For they heard them speake with tongues, and magnifie God. Then answered
b.ACT.10.47	Can any man forbid water, that these should not bee baptized, which haue
b.ACT.10.48	And hee commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed
b.ACT.10.5	And now send men to Ioppa, and call for one Simon, whose sirname is Peter.
b.ACT.10.6	Hee lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whose house is by the Sea side; he shall

b.ACT.10.8	And when he had declared all these things vnto them, he sent them to Ioppa.
b.ACT.10.9	On the morrow as they went on their iourney, and drew nigh vnto the citie,
b.ACT.1.1	The former treatise haue I made, O Theophilus, of al that Iesus began both to
b.ACT.1.10	And while they looked stedfastly toward heauen, as he went vp, behold, two
b.ACT.1.11	Which also said, Yee men of Galililee, why stand yee gazing vp into heauen?
b.ACT.11.1	And the Apostles, and brethren that were in Iudea, heard that the Gentiles had
b.ACT.11.10	And this was done three times: and all were drawen vp againe into heauen.
b.ACT.11.11	And behold, immediately there were three men already come vnto the house
b.ACT.11.12	And the spirit bad me goe with them, nothing doubting: Moreouer, these sixe
b.ACT.11.13	And he shewed vs how hee had seene an Angell in his house, which stood and
b.ACT.11.14	Who shall tell thee words, wherby thou, and all thy house shal be saued.
b.ACT.11.15	And as I began to speake, the holy Ghost fell on them, as on vs at the
b.ACT.11.16	Then remembred I the word of the Lord, how that he said, Iohn indeede
b.ACT.11.17	Forasmuch then as God gaue them the like gift as hee did vnto vs, who
b.ACT.11.18	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God,
b.ACT.11.19	Now they which were scattered abroad vpon the persecution that arose about
b.ACT.1.12	Then returned they vnto Hierusalem, from the mount called Oliuet, which is
b.ACT.11.2	And when Peter was come vp to Hierusalem, they that were of the circumcision
b.ACT.11.20	And some of them were men of
b.ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number beleeued, and
b.ACT.11.22	Then tidings of these things came vnto the eares of the Church, which was in
b.ACT.11.23	Who when hee came, and had seene the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted
b.ACT.11.24	For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith: and much
b.ACT.11.25	Then departed Barnabas to
b.ACT.11.26	And when he had found him, he brought him vnto
b.ACT.11.27	And in these dayes, came Prophets from Hierusalem vnto
b.ACT.11.28	And there stood vp one of them, named Agabus, and signified by the spirit,
b.ACT.11.29	Then the disciples, euery man according to his abilitie, determined to send
b.ACT.1.13	And when they were come in, they went vp into an vpper roome, where abode
b.ACT.11.3	Saying, Thou wentest in to men vncircumcised, &amp; didst eate with them.
b.ACT.11.30	Which also they did, and sent it to the Elders by the hands of Barnabas and
b.ACT.1.14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the
b.ACT.11.4	But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order
b.ACT.1.15	And in those dayes Peter stood vp in the mids of the disciples, and said,
b.ACT.11.5	I was in the citie of Ioppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a
b.ACT.1.16	Men and brethren, This Scripture must needs haue beene fulfilled, which the
b.ACT.11.6	Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw foure
b.ACT.1.17	For hee was numbred with vs, and had obtained part of this ministerie.
b.ACT.11.7	And I heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Arise Peter, slay, and eate.
b.ACT.1.18	Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling
b.ACT.11.8	But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or vncleane hath at any time
b.ACT.1.19	And it was knowen vnto all the dwellers at Hierusalem, insomuch as that field
b.ACT.11.9	But the voyce answered me againe from heauen, What God hath cleansed, that
b.ACT.1.2	Untill the day in which hee was taken vp, after that he through the holy Ghost
b.ACT.1.20	For it is written in the booke of Psalmes, Let his habitation be desolate,
b.ACT.1.21	Wherefore of these men which haue companied with vs all the time that the
b.ACT.12.1	Now about that time, Herode the King stretched foorth his hands, to vexe
b.ACT.12.10	When they were past the first and the second ward, they came vnto the yron
b.ACT.12.11	And when Peter was come to himselfe, hee said, Now I know of a suretie, that
b.ACT.12.12	And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother
b.ACT.12.13	And as Peter knocked at the doore of the gate, a damosell came to hearken,
b.ACT.12.14	And when she knew Peters voice, she opened not the gate for gladnes, but ran
b.ACT.12.15	And they said vnto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was
b.ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the doore, and saw
b.ACT.12.17	But he beckening vnto them with the hand, to hold their peace, declared vnto
b.ACT.12.18	Now assoone as it was day, there was no smal stirre among the souldiers, what
b.ACT.12.19	And when Herode had sought for him, and found him not, hee examined the
b.ACT.1.22	Beginning from the baptisme of Iohn, vnto that same day that he was taken vp
b.ACT.12.2	And he killed Iames the brother of Iohn with the sword.
b.ACT.12.20	And Herode was highly displeased with them of
b.ACT.12.21	And vpon a set day Herod arayed in royall apparell, sate vpon his throne, and
b.ACT.12.22	And the people gaue a shout, saying, It is the voice of a God, and not of a
b.ACT.12.23	And immediatly the Angel of the Lord smote him, because hee gaue not God the
b.ACT.12.24	But the word of God grewe, and multiplied.
b.ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Hierusalem, when they had fulfilled their
b.ACT.1.23	And they appointed two, Ioseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Iustus, and
b.ACT.12.3	And because he saw it pleased the Iewes, hee proceeded further, to take Peter
b.ACT.1.24	And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men,
b.ACT.12.4	And when hee had apprehended him, hee put him in prison, and deliuered him to
b.ACT.1.25	That hee may take part of this ministerie and Apostleship, from which Iudas
b.ACT.12.5	Peter therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the
b.ACT.1.26	And they gaue foorth their lots, and the lot fell vpon Matthias, and hee was
b.ACT.12.6	And when Herode would haue brought him foorth, the same night Peter was
b.ACT.12.7	And beholde, the Angel of the Lord came vpon him, and a light shined in the
b.ACT.12.8	And the Angel said vnto him, Girde thy selfe, and binde on thy sandales: And
b.ACT.12.9	And hee went out, and followed him, and wist not that it was true which was
b.ACT.1.3	To whom also he shewed himselfe aliue after his passion, by many infallible
b.ACT.13.1	Nowe there were in the Church that was at
b.ACT.13.10	And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischiefe, thou child of the deuil,
b.ACT.13.11	And now behold, the hand of the Lord is vpon thee, &amp; thou shalt be blind,
b.ACT.13.12	Then the Deputie when he sawe what was done, beleeued, being astonished at
b.ACT.13.13	Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in
b.ACT.13.14	But when they departed from Perga, they came to
b.ACT.13.15	And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the

b.ACT.13.17	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people
b.ACT.13.18	And about the time of fourtie yeeres suffered he their maners in the
b.ACT.13.19	And when he had destroyed seuen nations in the
b.ACT.13.2	As they ministred to the Lord, and fasted, the holy Ghost said, Separate me
b.ACT.13.20	And after that he gaue vnto them iudges, about the space of foure hundred and
b.ACT.13.21	And afterward they desired a King, and God gaue vnto them Saul the sonne of
b.ACT.13.22	And when he had remoued him, hee raised vp vnto them Dauid to be their king,
b.ACT.13.23	Of this mans seed hath God, according to his promise, raised vnto
b.ACT.13.24	When Iohn had first preached before his coming, the baptisme of repentance to

b.ACT.13.3	And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their handes on them, they sent
b.ACT.13.30	But God raised him fro the dead:
b.ACT.13.31	And he was seene many dayes of them which came vp with him from
b.ACT.13.32	And we declare vnto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made
b.ACT.13.33	God hath fulfilled the same vnto vs their children, in that he hath raised vp
b.ACT.13.34	And as concerning that he raised him vp from the dead, now no more to returne
b.ACT.13.35	Wherfore he saith also in another Psalme, Thou shalt not suffer thine holy
b.ACT.13.36	For Dauid after he had serued his owne generation by the will of God, fell on
b.ACT.13.37	But hee whom God raised againe, saw no corruption.
b.ACT.13.38	Be it knowen vnto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is
b.ACT.13.39	And by him all that beleeue, are iustified from all things, from which ye
b.ACT.13.4	So they being sent forth by the holy Ghost, departed vnto
b.ACT.13.40	Beware therefore, least that come vpon you which is spoken of in the
b.ACT.13.41	Behold, yee despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I worke a worke in your
b.ACT.13.42	And when the Iewes were gone out of the Synagogue, the Gentiles besought that
b.ACT.13.43	Now when the Congregation was broken vp, many of the Iewes, and religious
b.ACT.13.44	And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole citie together to heare the
b.ACT.13.45	But when the Iewes saw the multitudes, they were filled with enuie, and spake
b.ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word
b.ACT.13.47	For so hath the Lord comanded vs, saying, I haue set thee to bee a light of
b.ACT.13.48	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of
b.ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
b.ACT.13.5	And when they were at
b.ACT.13.50	But the Iewes stirred vp the deuout and honourable women, and the chiefe men
b.ACT.13.51	But they shooke off the dust of their feete against them, and came vnto
b.ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with ioy, and with the holy Ghost.
b.ACT.13.6	And when they had gone thorow the Ile vnto Paphos, they found a certaine
b.ACT.13.7	Which was with the deputie of the countrey Sergius Paulus, a prudent man: who
b.ACT.13.8	But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them,
b.ACT.13.9	Then Saul (who also is called Paul) filled with the holy Ghost, set his eyes
b.ACT.1.4	And being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not
b.ACT.14.1	And it came to passe in Iconium, that they went both together into the
b.ACT.14.10	Said with a lowd voice, Stand vpright on thy feete; And he leaped and walked.
b.ACT.14.11	And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lift vp their voyces, saying
b.ACT.14.12	And they called Barnabas Iupiter, and Paul Mercurius, because hee was the
b.ACT.14.13	Then the priest of Iupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen, and
b.ACT.14.14	Which when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their clothes,
b.ACT.14.15	And saying, Sirs, Why doe yee these things? Wee also are men of like passions
b.ACT.14.16	Who in times past, suffred all nations to walke in their owne wayes.
b.ACT.14.17	Neuerthelesse, he left not himselfe without witnesse, in that he did good,
b.ACT.14.18	And with these sayings scarse restrained they the people, that they had not
b.ACT.14.19	And there came thither certaine Iewes from
b.ACT.14.2	But the vnbeleeuing Iewes stirred vp the Gentiles, and made their mindes euill
b.ACT.14.20	Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose vp, and came into
b.ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many, they
b.ACT.14.22	Confirming the soules of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the
b.ACT.14.23	And when they had ordeined them Elders in
b.ACT.14.24	And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
b.ACT.14.25	And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went downe into Attalia,
b.ACT.14.26	And thence sailed to
b.ACT.14.27	And when they were come, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed
b.ACT.14.28	And there they abode long time with the disciples.
b.ACT.14.3	Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gaue
b.ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was diuided: and part held with the Iewes, and
b.ACT.14.5	And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Iewes,
b.ACT.14.6	They were ware of it, and fled vnto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and
b.ACT.14.7	And there they preached the Gospell.
b.ACT.14.8	And there sate a certaine man at Lystra, impotent in his feete, being a
b.ACT.14.9	The same heard Paul speake: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiuing that
b.ACT.1.5	For Iohn truely baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy
b.ACT.15.1	And certaine men which came downe from Iudea, taught the brethren, and said,
b.ACT.15.10	Now therfore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke vpon the necke of the disciples,
b.ACT.15.11	But we beleeue that through the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ, we shal be
b.ACT.15.12	Then all the multitude kept silence, and gaue audience to Barnabas and Paul,
b.ACT.15.13	And after they had helde their peace, Iames answered, saying, Men and
b.ACT.15.14	Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visite the Gentiles to take out
b.ACT.15.15	And to this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written,
b.ACT.15.16	After this I will returne, and wil build againe the Tabernacle of Dauid,
b.ACT.15.17	That the residue of men might seeke after the Lord, and all the Gentiles,
b.ACT.15.18	Knowen vnto God are all his workes fro the beginning of the world.
b.ACT.15.19	Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the
b.ACT.15.2	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissention and disputation with
b.ACT.15.20	But that wee write vnto them, that they abstaine from pollutions of Idoles,
b.ACT.15.21	For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preach him, being read
b.ACT.15.22	Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church, to send chosen
b.ACT.15.23	And wrote letters by them after this maner, The Apostles and Elders, and
b.ACT.15.24	Forasmuch as we haue heard, that certaine which went out from vs, haue
b.ACT.15.25	It seemed good vnto vs, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men
b.ACT.15.26	Men that haue hazarded their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.
b.ACT.15.27	Wee haue sent therefore Iudas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same
b.ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to vs, to lay vpon you no greater
b.ACT.15.29	That ye abstaine from meates offered to idoles, and from blood, &amp; from
b.ACT.15.3	And being brought on their way by the Church, they passed thorow Phenice and
b.ACT.15.30	So when they were dismissed, they came to
b.ACT.15.31	Which when they had read, they reioyced for the consolation.
b.ACT.15.32	And Iudas and Silas, being Prophets also themselues, exhorted the brethren
b.ACT.15.33	And after they had taried there a space, they were let goe in peace from the
b.ACT.15.34	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
b.ACT.15.35	Paul also and Barnabas continued in
b.ACT.15.36	And some dayes after, Paul said vnto Barnabas, Let vs go againe and visit our
b.ACT.15.37	And Barnabas determined to take with them Iohn, whose surname was Marke.
b.ACT.15.38	But Paul thought not good to take him with them; who departed from them from
b.ACT.15.39	And the contention was so sharpe betweene them, that they departed asunder
b.ACT.15.4	And when they were come to Hierusalem, they were receiued of the Church, and
b.ACT.15.40	And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren vnto
b.ACT.15.41	And he went thorow
b.ACT.15.5	But there rose vp certaine of the sect of the Pharisees which beleeued,
b.ACT.15.6	And the Apostles &amp; Elders came together for to consider of this matter.
b.ACT.15.7	And when there had bene much disputing, Peter rose vp, and said vnto them, Men
b.ACT.15.8	And God which knoweth the hearts, bare them witnes, giuing them the holy
b.ACT.15.9	And put no difference between vs &amp; them, purifying their hearts by faith.
b.ACT.1.6	When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt
b.ACT.16.1	Then came he to Derbe, and Lystra: and behold, a certaine disciple was there,
b.ACT.16.10	And after he had seene the vision, immediatly we endeuoured to goe into
b.ACT.16.11	Therfore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia,
b.ACT.16.12	And from thence to Philippi, which is the chiefe citie of that part of
b.ACT.16.13	And on the Sabboth we went out of the citie by a riuer side, where prayer was
b.ACT.16.14	And a certaine woman named
b.ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, and her houshold, she besought vs, saying, If ye
b.ACT.16.16	And it came to passe, as we went to prayer, a certaine Damosell possessed
b.ACT.16.17	The same followed Paul and vs, and cried, saying, These men are the seruants
b.ACT.16.18	And this did she many dayes: but Paul being grieued, turned and said to the
b.ACT.16.19	And when her Masters saw that the hope of their gaines was gone, they caught
b.ACT.16.2	Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
b.ACT.16.20	And brought them to the Magistrates, saying, These men being Iewes, do
b.ACT.16.21	And teach customes which are not lawfull for vs to receiue, neither to
b.ACT.16.22	And the multitude rose vp together against them, and the Magistrates rent off
b.ACT.16.23	And when they had layed many stripes vpon them, they cast them into prison,
b.ACT.16.24	Who hauing receiued such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, &amp;
b.ACT.16.25	And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises vnto God: and the
b.ACT.16.26	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the
b.ACT.16.27	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleepe, and seeing the prison
b.ACT.16.28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Doe thy selfe no harme, for we are
b.ACT.16.29	Then hee called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell
b.ACT.16.3	Him would Paul haue to go forth with him, and tooke, and circumcised him,
b.ACT.16.30	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I doe to be saued?
b.ACT.16.31	And they saide, Beleeue on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saued,
b.ACT.16.32	And they spake vnto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his
b.ACT.16.33	And hee tooke them the same houre of the night, and washed their stripes, and
b.ACT.16.34	And when he had brought them into his house, hee set meat before them, and
b.ACT.16.35	And when it was day, the Magistrates sent the Sergeants, saying, Let those
b.ACT.16.36	And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The Magistrates haue
b.ACT.16.37	But Paul said vnto them, They haue beaten vs openly vncondemned, being
b.ACT.16.38	And the Sergeants tolde these words vnto the Magistrates: and they feared
b.ACT.16.39	And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to
b.ACT.16.4	And as they went through the cities, they deliuered them the decrees for to
b.ACT.16.40	And they went out of the prison, and entred into the house of
b.ACT.16.5	And so were the Churches established in the faith, and increased in number
b.ACT.16.6	Now when they had gone thorowout Phrygia, and the region of
b.ACT.16.7	After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to goe into
b.ACT.16.8	And they passing by Mysia, came downe to
b.ACT.16.9	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There stood a man of
b.ACT.1.7	And he said vnto them, It is not for you to knowe the times or the seasons,
b.ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed thorow Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to
b.ACT.17.10	And the brethren immediatly sent away Paul and Silas by night vnto
b.ACT.17.11	These were more noble then those in Thessalonica, in that they receiued the
b.ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them beleeued: also of honourable women which were Greekes,
b.ACT.17.13	But when the Iewes of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was
b.ACT.17.14	And then immediatly the brethren sent away Paul, to goe as it were to the
b.ACT.17.15	And they that conducted Paul, brought him vnto
b.ACT.17.16	Now while Paul waited for them at
b.ACT.17.17	Therefore disputed he in the Synagogue with the Iewes, and with the deuout
b.ACT.17.18	Then certaine Philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoikes, encountred
b.ACT.17.19	And they tooke him, and brought him vnto Areopagus, saying, May we know what
b.ACT.17.2	And Paul, as his maner was, went in vnto them, and three Sabbath dayes
b.ACT.17.20	For thou bringest certaine strange things to our eares: we would know
b.ACT.17.21	(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there, spent their time in
b.ACT.17.22	Then Paul stood in the mids of Mars-hill, and said, Yee men of
b.ACT.17.23	For as I passed by, and beheld your deuotions, I found an Altar with this
b.ACT.17.24	God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that hee is Lord of
b.ACT.17.25	Neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing, seeing
b.ACT.17.26	And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face
b.ACT.17.27	That they should seeke the Lord, if haply they might feele after him and
b.ACT.17.28	For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as certaine also of your
b.ACT.17.29	Forasmuch then as wee are the offspring of God, wee ought not to thinke that
b.ACT.17.3	Opening and alleadging, that Christ must needs haue suffered and risen againe
b.ACT.17.30	And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men
b.ACT.17.31	Because hee hath appointed a day in the which he will iudge the world in
b.ACT.17.32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others
b.ACT.17.33	So Paul departed from among them.
b.ACT.17.34	Howbeit, certaine men claue vnto him, and beleeued: among the which was
b.ACT.17.4	And some of them beleeued, and consorted with Paul and Silas: and of the
b.ACT.17.5	But the Iewes which beleeued not, mooued with enuie, tooke vnto them certaine
b.ACT.17.6	And when they found them not, they drew Iason, and certaine brethren vnto the
b.ACT.17.7	Whom Iason hath receiued: and these all doe contrary to the decrees of Cesar,
b.ACT.17.8	And they troubled the people, and the rulers of the citie, when they heard
b.ACT.17.9	And when they had taken securitie of Iason, and of the other, they let them
b.ACT.1.8	But ye shall receiue power after that the holy Ghost is come vpon you, and ye
b.ACT.18.1	After these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth,
b.ACT.18.10	For I am with thee, and no man shal set on thee, to hurt thee: for I haue
b.ACT.18.11	And hee continued there a yeere and sixe monethes, teaching the word of God
b.ACT.18.12	And when Gallio was the Deputie of Achaia, the Iewes made insurrection with
b.ACT.18.13	Saying, This fellow perswadeth men to worship God contrary to the Law.
b.ACT.18.14	And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said vnto the Iewes, If
b.ACT.18.15	But if it be a question of words, and names, and of your law, looke ye to it:
b.ACT.18.16	And he draue them from the iudgment seate.
b.ACT.18.17	Then all the Greekes tooke Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, and
b.ACT.18.18	And Paul after this taried there yet a good while, and then tooke his leaue
b.ACT.18.19	And he came to
b.ACT.18.2	And found a certaine Iewe named Aquila, borne in Pontus, lately come from
b.ACT.18.20	When they desired him to tary longer time with them, hee consented not:
b.ACT.18.21	But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all meanes keepe this feast that
b.ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at Cesarea, and gone vp, and saluted the Church, he
b.ACT.18.23	And after he had spent some time there, hee departed, and went ouer all the
b.ACT.18.24	And a certaine Iew, named Apollos, borne at
b.ACT.18.25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being feruent in the
b.ACT.18.26	And he began to speake boldly in the Synagogue: whom when
b.ACT.18.27	And when hee was disposed to passe into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting
b.ACT.18.28	For hee mightily conuinced the Iewes, and that publikely, shewing by the
b.ACT.18.3	And because hee was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought (for by
b.ACT.18.4	And hee reasoned in the Synagogue euery Sabbath, and perswaded the Iewes, and
b.ACT.18.5	And when Silas and Timotheus were come from
b.ACT.18.6	And when they opposed themselues, and blasphemed, he shooke his raiment, and
b.ACT.18.7	And hee departed thence, and entred into a certaine mans house, named Iustus,
b.ACT.18.8	And Crispus, the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, beleeued on the Lord, with all
b.ACT.18.9	Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but
b.ACT.1.9	And when hee had spoken these things, while they beheld, hee was taken vp, and
b.ACT.19.1	And it came to passe, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul hauing passed
b.ACT.19.10	And this continued by the space of two yeeres, so that all they which dwelt
b.ACT.19.11	And God wrought speciall miracles by the hands of Paul:
b.ACT.19.12	So that from his body were brought vnto the sicke handkerchiefs or aprons,
b.ACT.19.13	Then certaine of the vagabond Iewes, exorcistes, tooke vpon them to call ouer
b.ACT.19.14	And there were seuen sonnes of one Sceua a Iewe, and chiefe of the Priests,
b.ACT.19.15	And the euill spirit answered, and said, Iesus I knowe, and Paul I know, but
b.ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the euill spirit was, leapt on them, and ouercame them,
b.ACT.19.17	And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Greekes also dwelling at
b.ACT.19.18	And many that beleeued came, and confessed, and shewed their deedes.
b.ACT.19.19	Many also of them which vsed curious arts, brought their bookes together and
b.ACT.19.2	He said vnto them, Haue ye receiued the holy Ghost since yee beleeued? And
b.ACT.19.20	So mightily grew the word of God, and preuailed.
b.ACT.19.21	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when hee had
b.ACT.19.22	So hee sent into
b.ACT.19.23	And the same time there arose no small stirre about that way.
b.ACT.19.24	For a certaine man named Demetrius, a siluer smith, which made siluer shrines
b.ACT.19.25	Whom he called together, with the workemen of like occupation, and said,
b.ACT.19.26	Moreouer, ye see &amp; heare, that not alone at
b.ACT.19.27	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought: but also
b.ACT.19.28	And when they heard these sayings, they were ful of wrath, &amp; cried out,
b.ACT.19.29	And the whole citie was filled with confusion, and hauing caught Gaius and
b.ACT.19.3	And he said vnto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they saide, Unto
b.ACT.19.30	And when Paul would haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffered
b.ACT.19.31	And certaine of the chiefe of
b.ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was
b.ACT.19.33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Iewes putting him forward.
b.ACT.19.34	But when they knew that he was a Iewe, all with one voyce about the space of
b.ACT.19.35	And when the towne clarke had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of
b.ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet,
b.ACT.19.37	For ye haue brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of Churches,
b.ACT.19.38	Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftesmen which are with him, haue a matter
b.ACT.19.39	But if yee enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shalbe determined
b.ACT.19.4	Then saide Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying
b.ACT.19.40	For we are in danger to be called in question for this dayes vprore, there
b.ACT.19.41	And when hee had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
b.ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.
b.ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laide his hands vpon them, the holy Ghost came on them, and
b.ACT.19.7	And all ye men were about twelue.
b.ACT.19.8	And hee went into the Synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three
b.ACT.19.9	But when diuers were hardened, and beleeued not, but spake euill of that way
b.ACT.20.1	And after the vprore was ceased, Paul called vnto him the disciples, and
b.ACT.20.10	And Paul went downe, and fell on him, and embracing him, saide, Trouble not
b.ACT.20.11	When hee therefore was come vp againe, &amp; had broken bread, and eaten, and
b.ACT.20.12	And they brought the yong man aliue, and were not a little comforted.
b.ACT.20.13	And wee went before to ship, and sailed vnto Assos, there intending to take
b.ACT.20.14	And when he met with vs at Assos, wee tooke him in, and came to Mitylene.
b.ACT.20.15	And wee sailed thence, and came the next day ouer against Chios, and the next
b.ACT.20.16	For Paul had determined to saile by
b.ACT.20.17	And from
b.ACT.20.18	And when they were come to him, he said vnto them, Ye know from the first day
b.ACT.20.19	Seruing the Lord with all humilitie of minde, and with many teares, and
b.ACT.20.2	And when he had gone ouer those parts, and had giuen them much exhortation, he
b.ACT.20.20	And how I kept backe nothing that was profitable vnto you, but haue shewed
b.ACT.20.21	Testifying both to the Iewes and also to the Greekes, repentance toward God,
b.ACT.20.22	And now behold, I goe bound in the spirit vnto Hierusalem, not knowing the
b.ACT.20.23	Saue that the holy Ghost witnesseth in euery city, saying that bonds and
b.ACT.20.24	But none of these things mooue me, neither count I my life deare vnto my
b.ACT.20.25	And now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I haue gone preaching the
b.ACT.20.26	Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all
b.ACT.20.27	For I haue not shunned to declare vnto you all the counsell of God.
b.ACT.20.28	Take heed therefore vnto your selues, &amp; to all the flocke, ouer the which
b.ACT.20.29	For I know this, that after my departing shall grieuous wolues enter in among
b.ACT.20.3	And there abode three moneths: and when the Iewes layed waite for him, as hee
b.ACT.20.30	Also of your owne selues shal men arise, speaking peruerse things, to draw
b.ACT.20.31	Therefore watch, and remember that by the space of three yeeres, I ceased not
b.ACT.20.32	And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which
b.ACT.20.33	I haue coueted no mans siluer, or golde, or apparell.
b.ACT.20.34	Yea, you your selues know, that these handes haue ministred vnto my
b.ACT.20.35	I haue shewed you all things, how that so labouring, yee ought to support the
b.ACT.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled downe, &amp; prayed with them all.
b.ACT.20.37	And they all wept sore, and fell on Pauls necke, and kissed him,
b.ACT.20.38	Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his
b.ACT.20.4	And there accompanied him into
b.ACT.20.5	These going before, taried for vs at Troas:
b.ACT.20.6	And wee sailed away from Philippi, after the dayes of vnleauened bread, and
b.ACT.20.7	And vpon the first day of the weeke, when the disciples came together to
b.ACT.20.8	And there were many lights in the vpper chamber where they were gathered
b.ACT.20.9	And there sate in a window a certaine yong man named Eutychus, being fallen
b.ACT.2.1	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in
b.ACT.2.10	Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya, about Cyrene,
b.ACT.2.11	Cretes, and Arabians, we doe heare them speake in our tongues the wonderfull
b.ACT.21.1	And it came to passe, that after wee were gotten fro them, and had lanched,
b.ACT.21.10	And as wee taried there many dayes, there came downe from Iudea a certaine
b.ACT.21.11	And when he was come vnto vs, he tooke Pauls girdle, and bound his owne hands
b.ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place, besought him
b.ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, What meane ye to weepe and to breake mine heart? for I am
b.ACT.21.14	And when he would not bee perswaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord
b.ACT.21.15	And after those dayes we tooke vp our cariages, &amp; went vp to Hierusalem.
b.ACT.21.16	There went with vs also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought
b.ACT.21.17	And when we were come to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs gladly
b.ACT.21.18	And the day following Paul went in with vs vnto Iames, and all the Elders
b.ACT.21.19	And when hee had saluted them, hee declared particularly what things God had
b.ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What
b.ACT.21.2	And finding a ship sailing ouer vnto Phenicea, wee went abroad, and set foorth.
b.ACT.21.20	And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, &amp; said vnto him, Thou
b.ACT.21.21	And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes which are
b.ACT.21.22	What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will
b.ACT.21.23	Doe therefore this that we say to thee: Wee haue foure men which haue a vow
b.ACT.21.24	Then take, and purifie thy selfe with them, &amp; bee at charges with them,
b.ACT.21.25	As touching the Gentiles which beleeue, wee haue written and concluded, that
b.ACT.21.26	Then Paul tooke the men, and the next day purifying himselfe with them,
b.ACT.21.27	And when the seuen dayes were almost ended, the Iewes which were of Asia,
b.ACT.21.28	Crying out, Men of Israel, helpe: this is ye man that teacheth al men euery
b.ACT.21.29	(For they had seene before with him in the citie, Trophimus an Ephesian,
b.ACT.2.13	Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
b.ACT.21.3	Now when wee had discouered
b.ACT.21.30	And all the citie was moued, and the people ran together: and they tooke
b.ACT.21.31	And as they went about to kil him, tidings came vnto the chiefe captaine of
b.ACT.21.32	Who immediatly tooke souldiers, and Centurions, and ran downe vnto them: and
b.ACT.21.33	Then the chiefe captain came neere, and tooke him, &amp; commanded him to be

b.ACT.21.37	And as Paul was to bee led into the castle, hee saide vnto the chiefe
b.ACT.21.38	Art not thou that Egyptian which before these daies madest an vprore, and
b.ACT.21.39	But Paul said, I am a man which am a Iew of Tarsus, a citie in Cilicia, a

b.ACT.21.4	And finding disciples, wee taried there seuen dayes: who said to Paul through
b.ACT.21.40	And when he had giuen him licence, Paul stood on the staires, and beckened
b.ACT.2.15	For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third houre of
b.ACT.21.5	And when we had accomplished those dayes, we departed, and went our way, and
b.ACT.2.16	But this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Ioel,
b.ACT.21.6	And when we had taken our leaue one of another, we tooke ship, and they
b.ACT.2.17	And it shall come to passe in the last dayes (saith God) I will powre out of
b.ACT.21.7	And when wee had finished our course from
b.ACT.2.18	And on my seruants, and on my handmaidens, I will powre out in those daies of
b.ACT.21.8	And the next day we that were of Pauls company, departed, and came vnto
b.ACT.2.19	And I wil shew wonders in heauen aboue, and signes in the earth beneath:
b.ACT.21.9	And ye same man had foure daughters, virgins, which did prophesie.
b.ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came a sound from heauen as of a rushing mighty wind, and
b.ACT.2.20	The Sunne shall be turned into darkenesse, and the Moone into blood, before
b.ACT.2.21	And it shall come to passe, that whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the
b.ACT.22.1	Men, brethren, and fathers, heare ye my defence which I make now vnto you.
b.ACT.22.10	And I saide, What shall I doe, Lord? And the Lord said vnto me, Arise, and
b.ACT.22.11	And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand
b.ACT.22.12	And one Ananias, a deuout man according to the law, hauing a good report of
b.ACT.22.13	Came vnto me, and stood, &amp; said vnto me, Brother Saul, receiue thy sight.
b.ACT.22.14	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest
b.ACT.22.15	For thou shalt be his witnes vnto al men, of what thou hast seene &amp;
b.ACT.22.16	And now, why tariest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sinnes,
b.ACT.22.17	And it came to passe, that when I was come againe to Hierusalem, euen while I
b.ACT.22.18	And saw him saying vnto mee, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of
b.ACT.22.19	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in euery synagogue
b.ACT.2.22	Yee men of Israel, heare these words, Iesus of Nazareth, a man approued of

b.ACT.22.20	And when ye blood of thy martyr Steuen was shed, I also was standing by, and
b.ACT.22.21	And he said vnto me, Depart: for I will send thee farre hence, vnto the
b.ACT.22.22	And they gaue him audience vnto this word, and then lift vp their voices, and
b.ACT.22.23	And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, &amp; threw dust into the
b.ACT.22.24	The chiefe captaine commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade
b.ACT.22.25	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said vnto the Centurion that stood
b.ACT.22.26	When the Centurion heard that, hee went and told the chiefe captaine, saying,
b.ACT.22.27	Then the chiefe captaine came; and said vnto him, Tell me, art thou a Romane?
b.ACT.22.28	And the chiefe captaine answered, With a great summe obteined I this freedome.
b.ACT.22.29	Then straightway they departed from him which should haue examined him: and
b.ACT.2.23	Him, being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God,
b.ACT.22.3	I am verely a man which am a Iew, borne in Tarsus a citie in Cilicia, yet
b.ACT.22.30	On the morrow, because he would haue knowen the certaintie wherefore he was
b.ACT.2.24	Whom God hath raised vp, hauing loosed the paines of death: because it was
b.ACT.22.4	And I persecuted this way vnto the death, binding and deliuering into prisons
b.ACT.2.25	For Dauid speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord alwayes before my face,
b.ACT.22.5	As also the high Priest doth beare me witnesse, and all the estate of the
b.ACT.2.26	Therefore did my heart reioyce, and my tongue was glad: Moreouer also, my
b.ACT.22.6	And it came to passe, that as I made my iourney, &amp; was come nigh vnto
b.ACT.2.27	Because thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine
b.ACT.22.7	And I fell vnto the ground, and heard a voice saying vnto mee, Saul, Saul, why
b.ACT.2.28	Thou hast made knowen to mee the wayes of life, thou shalt make mee full of
b.ACT.22.8	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said vnto me, I am Iesus of
b.ACT.2.29	Men and brethren, let me freely speake vnto you of the Patriarch Dauid, that
b.ACT.22.9	And they that were with me saw indeede the light, and were afraid; but they
b.ACT.2.3	And there appeared vnto them clouen tongues, like as of fire, and it sate vpon
b.ACT.2.30	Therefore being a Prophet, and knowing that God had sworne with an oath to
b.ACT.2.31	He seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule
b.ACT.23.1	And Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I haue liued
b.ACT.23.10	And when there arose a great dissension, the chiefe captaine fearing lest
b.ACT.23.11	And the night folowing, the Lord stood by him, and saide, Bee of good cheere,
b.ACT.23.12	And when it was day, certaine of the Iewes banded together, and bound
b.ACT.23.13	And they were more then fourtie which had made this conspiracie.
b.ACT.23.14	And they came to the chiefe Priests and Elders, and said, Wee haue bound our
b.ACT.23.15	Now therefore ye with the Councill, signifie to the chiefe captaine that he
b.ACT.23.16	And when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying in wait, hee went and
b.ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the Centurions vnto him, and said, Bring this yong
b.ACT.23.18	So he took him, and brought him to the chiefe captaine, and said, Paul the
b.ACT.23.19	Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hand, and went with him aside
b.ACT.2.32	This Iesus hath God raised vp, whereof we all are witnesses.
b.ACT.23.2	And the high Priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him, to smite him on
b.ACT.23.20	And he said, The Iewes haue agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring
b.ACT.23.21	But do not thou yeeld vnto them: for there lie in wait for him of them moe
b.ACT.23.22	So the chiefe captaine then let the yong man depart, and charged him, See
b.ACT.23.23	And he called vnto him two Centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred
b.ACT.23.24	And prouide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe vnto
b.ACT.23.25	And hee wrote a letter after this manner:
b.ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias, vnto the most excellent Gouernour Felix, sendeth greeting.
b.ACT.23.27	This man was taken of the Iewes and should haue beene killed of them: Then
b.ACT.23.28	And when I would haue knowen the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought
b.ACT.23.29	Whom I perceiued to be accused of questions of their lawe, but to haue
b.ACT.2.33	Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and hauing receiued of the
b.ACT.23.3	Then saith Paul vnto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest
b.ACT.23.30	And when it was tolde me, how that the Iewes laid waite for the man, I sent
b.ACT.23.31	Then the souldiers, as it was commaunded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by
b.ACT.23.32	On the morow, they left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned to the
b.ACT.23.33	Who when they came to Cesarea, and deliuered the Epistle to the gouernour,
b.ACT.23.34	And when the gouernour had read the letter, he asked of what prouince he was.
b.ACT.23.35	I will heare thee, said hee, when thine accusers are also come. And hee
b.ACT.2.34	For Dauid is not ascended into the heauens, but he saith himselfe, The Lord
b.ACT.23.4	And they that stood by, said, Reuilest thou Gods high Priest?
b.ACT.2.35	Untill I make thy foes thy footstoole.
b.ACT.23.5	Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that hee was the high Prist: For it is
b.ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of
b.ACT.23.6	But when Paul perceiued that the one part were Sadducees, and the other
b.ACT.2.37	Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said vnto
b.ACT.23.7	And when hee had so said, there arose a dissension betweene the Pharisees and
b.ACT.2.38	Then Peter said vnto them, Repent, and be baptized euery one of you in the
b.ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither Angel, nor
b.ACT.2.39	For the promise is vnto you, and to your children, and to all that are afarre
b.ACT.23.9	And there arose a great cry: and the Scribes that were of the Pharisees part
b.ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and began to speake with other
b.ACT.2.40	And with many other words did hee testifie and exhort, saying, Saue your
b.ACT.2.41	Then they that gladly receiued his word, were baptized: and the same day
b.ACT.24.1	And after fiue dayes, Ananias the hie Priest descended with the Elders, and
b.ACT.24.10	Then Paul, after that the gouernour had beckened vnto him to speake,
b.ACT.24.11	Because that thou mayest vnderstand, that there are yet but twelue dayes,
b.ACT.24.12	And they neither found me in the
b.ACT.24.13	Neither can they proue the things whereof they now accuse me.
b.ACT.24.14	But this I confesse vnto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so
b.ACT.24.15	And haue hope towards God, which they themselues also allow, that there shall

b.ACT.24.17	Now after many yeeres, I came to bring almes to my nation, &amp; offrings:
b.ACT.24.18	Wherupon certaine Iewes from Asia found me purified in the Temple, neither
b.ACT.24.19	Who ought to haue beene here before thee, and obiect, if they had ought
b.ACT.2.42	And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in
b.ACT.24.2	And when he was called foorth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing
b.ACT.24.20	Or else let these same here say, if they haue found any euill doing in mee,
b.ACT.24.21	Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching
b.ACT.24.22	And when Felix heard these things, hauing more perfect knowledge of that way,
b.ACT.24.23	And he commanded a Centurion to keepe Paul, and to let him haue libertie, and
b.ACT.24.24	And after certaine dayes, when Felix came with his wife Orusilla, which was a
b.ACT.24.25	And as he reasoned of righteousnesse, temperance, and iudgement to come,
b.ACT.24.26	He hoped also that money should haue bene giuen him of Paul, that hee might
b.ACT.24.27	But after two yeeres, Portius Festus came into Felix roome: and Felix willing
b.ACT.2.43	And feare came vpon euery soule: and many wonders and signes were done by the
b.ACT.24.3	Wee accept it alwayes, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all
b.ACT.2.44	And all that beleeued were together, and had all things common,
b.ACT.24.4	Notwithstanding, that I be not farther tedious vnto thee, I pray thee, that
b.ACT.2.45	And solde their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as euery
b.ACT.24.5	For we haue found this man a pestilent fellow, and a moouer of sedition among
b.ACT.2.46	And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread
b.ACT.24.6	Who also hath gone about to profane the
b.ACT.2.47	Praising God, and hauing fauour with all the people. And the Lord added to
b.ACT.24.7	But the chiefe captaine Lysias came vpon vs, and with great violence tooke him
b.ACT.24.8	Commanding his accusers to come vnto thee, by examining of whom thy selfe
b.ACT.24.9	And the Iewes also assented, saying that these things were so.
b.ACT.2.5	And there were dwelling at Hierusalem Iewes, deuout men, out of euery nation
b.ACT.25.1	Nowe when Festus was come into the prouince, after three dayes he ascended fro
b.ACT.25.10	Then said Paul, I stand at Cesars iudgement seat, where I ought to bee iudged;
b.ACT.25.11	For if I be an offender, or haue committed any thing worthy of death, I
b.ACT.25.12	Then Festus when he had conferred with the Councill, answered, Hast thou
b.ACT.25.13	And after certaine dayes, king Agrippa and Bernice, came vnto Cesarea, to
b.ACT.25.14	And when they had beene there many dayes, Festus declared Pauls cause vnto
b.ACT.25.15	About whom when I was at Hierusalem, the chiefe Priests and the Elders of the
b.ACT.25.16	To whom I answered, It is not the maner of the Romanes to deliuer any man to
b.ACT.25.17	Therefore when they were come hither, without any delay, on the morrow I sate
b.ACT.25.18	Against whom when the accusers stood vp, they brought none accusation of such
b.ACT.25.19	But had certaine questions against him of their owne superstition, and of one
b.ACT.25.2	Then the high Priest, and the chiefe of the Iewes informed him against Paul,
b.ACT.25.20	And because I doubted of such maner of questions, I asked him whether he
b.ACT.25.21	But when Paul had appealed to bee reserued vnto the hearing of Augustus, I
b.ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa said vnto Festus, I would also heare the man my selfe. To
b.ACT.25.23	And on the morrow when Agrippa was come and Bernice, with great pompe, and
b.ACT.25.24	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are heere present with vs,
b.ACT.25.25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he
b.ACT.25.26	Of whom I haue no certaine thing to write vnto my Lord: Wherefore I haue
b.ACT.25.27	For it seemeth to me vnreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not withall to
b.ACT.25.3	And desired fauour against him, that he would send for him to Hierusalem,
b.ACT.25.4	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that hee
b.ACT.25.5	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go downe with me, and
b.ACT.25.6	And when hee had taried among them more then ten dayes, hee went downe vnto
b.ACT.25.7	And when hee was come, the Iewes which came downe from Hierusalem, stood round
b.ACT.25.8	While hee answered for himselfe, Neither against the law of the Iewes, neither
b.ACT.25.9	But Festus willing to doe the Iewes a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt
b.ACT.2.6	Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were
b.ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said vnto Paul, Thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe. Then
b.ACT.26.10	Which thing I also did in Hierusalem, and many of the Saints did I shut vp in
b.ACT.26.11	And I punished them oft in euery Synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme,
b.ACT.26.12	Whereupon, as I went to Damascus, with authoritie and commission from the
b.ACT.26.13	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heauen, aboue the brightnes
b.ACT.26.14	And when wee were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking vnto me,
b.ACT.26.15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And hee said, I am Iesus whom thou
b.ACT.26.16	But rise, and stand vpon thy feete, for I haue appeared vnto thee for this
b.ACT.26.17	Deliuering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, vnto whom now I send
b.ACT.26.18	To open their eyes, and to turne them from darknesse to light, and from the
b.ACT.26.19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient vnto the heauenly vision:
b.ACT.26.2	I thinke my selfe happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answere for my selfe
b.ACT.26.20	But shewed first vnto them of
b.ACT.26.21	For these causes the Iewes caught mee in the
b.ACT.26.22	Hauing therefore obteined helpe of God, I continue vnto this day, witnessing
b.ACT.26.23	That Christ should suffer, and that hee should be the first that should rise
b.ACT.26.24	And as hee thus spake for himselfe, Festus saide with a lowd voyce, Paul,
b.ACT.26.25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speake foorth the words of
b.ACT.26.26	For the King knoweth of these things, before whom also I speake freely: for I
b.ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, beleeuest thou the Prophets? I know that thou beleeuest.
b.ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa saide vnto Paul, Almost thou perswadest mee to bee a Christian.
b.ACT.26.29	And Paul said, I would to God, that not onely thou, but also all that heare
b.ACT.26.3	Especially, because I know thee to be expert in all customes and questions
b.ACT.26.30	And when hee had thus spoken, the king rose vp, and the gouernour, and
b.ACT.26.31	And when they were gone aside, they talked betweene themselues, saying, This
b.ACT.26.32	Then said Agrippa vnto Festus, This man might haue bene set at libertie, if
b.ACT.26.4	My maner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine owne nation
b.ACT.26.5	Which knew me from the beginning, (if they would testifie) that after the most
b.ACT.26.6	And now I stand, and am iudged for the hope of the promise made of God vnto
b.ACT.26.7	Vnto which promise our twelue tribes instantly seruing God day and night, hope
b.ACT.26.8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise
b.ACT.26.9	I verily thought with my selfe, that I ought to doe many things contrary to
b.ACT.2.7	And they were all amazed, and marueiled, saying one to another, Behold, are
b.ACT.27.1	And when it was determined, that wee should saile into
b.ACT.27.10	And said vnto them, Sirs, I perceiue that this voyage will be with hurt and
b.ACT.27.11	Neuerthelesse, the Centurion beleeued the master and the owner of the shippe,
b.ACT.27.12	And because the hauen was not commodious to winter in, the more part aduised
b.ACT.27.13	And when the South wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their
b.ACT.27.14	But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous winde, called
b.ACT.27.15	And when the ship was caught, and could not beare vp into the winde, we let
b.ACT.27.16	And running vnder a certaine yland, which is called Clauda, wee had much
b.ACT.27.17	Which when they had taken vp, they vsed helps, vnder-girding the ship; and
b.ACT.27.18	And being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day, they lightened the
b.ACT.27.19	And the third day we cast out with our owne handes the tackling of the shippe.
b.ACT.27.2	And entring into a ship of Adramyttium, wee lanched, meaning to saile by the
b.ACT.27.20	And when neither Sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared, and no small
b.ACT.27.21	But after long abstinence, Paul stood foorth in the middes of them, and said,
b.ACT.27.22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheere: for there shall be no losse of any
b.ACT.27.23	For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whom I
b.ACT.27.24	Saying, Feare not Paul, thou must be brought before Cesar, and loe, God hath
b.ACT.27.25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheere: for I beleeue God, that it shall be euen
b.ACT.27.26	Howbeit, we must be cast vpon a certaine Iland.
b.ACT.27.27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as wee were driuen vp and downe in
b.ACT.27.28	And sounded, and found it twentie fathoms: and when they had gone a little
b.ACT.27.29	Then fearing lest we should haue fallen vpon rockes, they cast foure ancres
b.ACT.27.3	And the next day wee touched at Sidon: And Iulius courteously entreated Paul,
b.ACT.27.30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let
b.ACT.27.31	Paul said to the Centurion, and to the souldiers, Except these abide in the
b.ACT.27.32	Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
b.ACT.27.33	And while the day was comming on, Paul besought them all to take meat,
b.ACT.27.34	Wherefore, I pray you to take some meat, for this is for your health: for
b.ACT.27.35	And when hee had thus spoken, hee tooke bread, and gaue thankes to God in
b.ACT.27.36	Then were they all of good cheere, and they also tooke some meat.
b.ACT.27.37	And we were in all, in the ship, two hundred, threescore and sixteene soules.
b.ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the
b.ACT.27.39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discouered a certaine
b.ACT.27.4	And when we had lanched from thence, we sailed vnder
b.ACT.27.40	And when they had taken vp the ankers, they committed themselues vnto the
b.ACT.27.41	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ranne the shippe a ground,
b.ACT.27.42	And the souldiers counsel was to kil the prisoners, lest any of them should
b.ACT.27.43	But the Centurion, willing to saue Paul, kept them from their purpose, and
b.ACT.27.44	And the rest, some on boords, and some on broken pieces of the ship: and so
b.ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed ouer the
b.ACT.27.6	And there the Centurion found a ship of
b.ACT.27.7	And when wee had sailed slowly many dayes, and scarse were come ouer against
b.ACT.27.8	And hardly passing it, came vnto a place which is called the Faire hauens,
b.ACT.27.9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the
b.ACT.2.8	And how heare we euery man in our owne tongue, wherein we were borne?
b.ACT.28.1	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the Iland was called Melita.
b.ACT.28.10	Who also honoured vs with many honours, and when wee departed, they laded vs
b.ACT.28.11	And after three moneths wee departed in a ship of
b.ACT.28.12	And landing at
b.ACT.28.13	And from thence wee fet a compasse, and came to Rhegium, and after one day
b.ACT.28.14	Where wee found brethren, and were desired to tary with them seuen dayes: and
b.ACT.28.15	And from thence, when the brethren heard of vs, they came to meet vs as farre
b.ACT.28.16	And when we came to
b.ACT.28.17	And it came to passe, that after three dayes, Paul called the chiefe of the
b.ACT.28.18	Who when they had examined me, would haue let me goe, because there was no
b.ACT.28.19	But when the Iewes spake against it, I was constrained to appeale vnto Cesar,
b.ACT.28.2	And the barbarous people shewed vs no little kindnesse: for they kindled a
b.ACT.28.20	For this cause therefore haue I called for you, to see you, and to speake
b.ACT.28.21	And they saide vnto him, Wee neither receiued letters out of Iudea concerning
b.ACT.28.22	But we desire to heare of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this
b.ACT.28.23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his
b.ACT.28.24	And some beleeued the things which were spoken, and some beleeued not.
b.ACT.28.25	And when they agreed not among themselues, they departed, after that Paul had
b.ACT.28.26	Saying, Goe vnto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall heare, and shall not
b.ACT.28.27	For the heart of this people is waxed grosse, and their eares are dull of
b.ACT.28.28	Be it knowen therfore vnto you, that the saluation of God is sent vnto the
b.ACT.28.29	And when hee had saide these words, the Iewes departed, and had great
b.ACT.28.3	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of stickes, and layde them on the fire,
b.ACT.28.30	And Paul dwelt two whole yeeres in his owne hired house, and receiued all
b.ACT.28.31	Preaching the kingdome of God, and teaching those things which concerne the
b.ACT.28.4	And when the Barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they saide
b.ACT.28.5	And hee shooke off the beast into the fire, and felt no harme.
b.ACT.28.6	Howbeit, they looked when hee should haue swollen, or fallen downe dead
b.ACT.28.7	In the same quarters were possessions of the chiefe man of the Iland, whose
b.ACT.28.8	And it came to passe that the father of Publius lay sicke of a feuer, and of a
b.ACT.28.9	So when this was done, others also which had diseases in the Iland, came, and
b.ACT.2.9	Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in
b.ACT.3.1	Nowe Peter and Iohn went vp together into the
b.ACT.3.10	And they knew that it was hee which sate for almes at the beautifull gate of
b.ACT.3.11	And as the lame man which was healed, helde Peter and Iohn, all the people
b.ACT.3.12	And when Peter sawe it, hee answered vnto the people, Yee men of
b.ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Iacob, the God of our fathers hath
b.ACT.3.14	But ye denied the Holy one, and the Iust, and desired a murderer to be
b.ACT.3.15	And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we
b.ACT.3.16	And his Name through faith in his Name hath made this man strong, whom ye see
b.ACT.3.17	And now brethren, I wote that through ignorance yee did it, as did also your
b.ACT.3.18	But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his
b.ACT.3.19	Repent yee therefore, and bee conuerted, that your sins may be blotted out,
b.ACT.3.2	And a certaine man lame from his mothers womb was caried, whom they laide
b.ACT.3.20	And hee shall send Iesus Christ, which before was preached vnto you.
b.ACT.3.21	Whom the heauen must receiue, vntill the times of restitution of all things,
b.ACT.3.22	For Moses truely said vnto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God
b.ACT.3.23	And it shall come to passe, that euery soule which will not heare that
b.ACT.3.24	Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as
b.ACT.3.25	Yee are the children of the Prophets, and of the couenant which God made with
b.ACT.3.26	Unto you first, God hauing raised vp his Sonne Iesus, sent him to blesse you,
b.ACT.3.3	Who seeing Peter &amp; Iohn about to go into the
b.ACT.3.4	And Peter fastening his eyes vpon him, with Iohn, said, Looke on vs.
b.ACT.3.5	And he gaue heede vnto them, expecting to receiue something of them.
b.ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, Siluer and gold haue I none, but such as I haue, giue I thee:
b.ACT.3.7	And hee tooke him by the right hand, &amp; lift him vp: aud immediatly his
b.ACT.3.8	And hee leaping vp, stood, and walked, and entred with them into the
b.ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking, and praising God.
b.ACT.4.1	And as they spake vnto the people, the Priests and the captaine of the
b.ACT.4.10	Be it knowen vnto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the Name
b.ACT.4.11	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become
b.ACT.4.12	Neither is there saluation in any other: for there is none other name vnder
b.ACT.4.13	Now when they sawe the boldnesse of Peter and Iohn, and perceiued that they
b.ACT.4.14	And beholding the man which was healed, standing with them, they could say
b.ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the Council, they
b.ACT.4.16	Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath
b.ACT.4.17	But that it spread no farther among the people, let vs straitly threaten
b.ACT.4.18	And they called them, and commanded them, not to speake at all, nor teach in
b.ACT.4.19	But Peter and Iohn answered, and said vnto them, Whether it be right in the
b.ACT.4.2	Being grieued that they taught the people, and preached through Iesus the
b.ACT.4.20	For wee cannot but speake the things which we haue seene and heard.
b.ACT.4.21	So when they had further threatned them, they let them goe, finding nothing
b.ACT.4.22	For the man was aboue fourtie yeeres olde, on whome this miracle of healing
b.ACT.4.23	And being let goe, they went to their owne company, and reported all that the
b.ACT.4.24	And when they heard that, they lift vp their voyce to God with one accord,
b.ACT.4.25	Who by the mouth of thy seruant Dauid hast saide, Why did the heathen rage,
b.ACT.4.26	The Kings of the earth stood vp, and the rulers were gathered together
b.ACT.4.27	For of a trueth against thy holy child Iesus, whom thou hast anointed, both
b.ACT.4.28	For to doe whatsoeuer thy hand and thy counsell determined before to be done.
b.ACT.4.29	And now Lord, behold their threatnings, and graunt vnto thy seruants, that
b.ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold vnto the next day: for it
b.ACT.4.30	By stretching foorth thine hand to heale: and that signes and wonders may be
b.ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled
b.ACT.4.32	And the multitude of them that beleeued, were of one heart, and of one soule:
b.ACT.4.33	And with great power gaue the Apostles witnesse of the resurrection of the
b.ACT.4.34	Neither was there any among them that lacked: For as many as were possessors
b.ACT.4.35	And laide them downe at the Apostles feete: And distribution was made vnto
b.ACT.4.36	And Ioses, who by the Apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being
b.ACT.4.37	Hauing land, sold it, and brought the money, &amp; laid it at the Apostles
b.ACT.4.4	Howbeit, many of them which heard the word, beleeued, and the number of the
b.ACT.4.5	And it came to passe on the morow, that their rulers, and Elders, and Scribes,
b.ACT.4.6	And Annas the high Priest, and Caiphas, and Iohn, and Alexander, and as many
b.ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the middest, they asked, By what power, or by
b.ACT.4.8	Then Peter filled with the holy Ghost, said vnto them, Ye rulers of the
b.ACT.4.9	If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what
b.ACT.5.1	But a certaine man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, solde a possession,
b.ACT.5.10	Then fell she downe straightway at his feete, and yeelded vp the ghost: And
b.ACT.5.11	And great feare came vpon all the Church, and vpon as many as heard these
b.ACT.5.12	And by the hands of the Apostles, were many signes and wonders wrought among
b.ACT.5.13	And of the rest durst no man ioyne himselfe to them: But the people magnified
b.ACT.5.14	And beleeuers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and
b.ACT.5.15	Insomuch that they brought foorth the sicke into the streetes, and layed them
b.ACT.5.16	There came also a multitude out of the cities round about vnto Hierusalem,
b.ACT.5.17	Then the high Priest rose vp, and al they that were with him, (which is the
b.ACT.5.18	And laid their hands on the Apostles, &amp; put them in the common prison.
b.ACT.5.19	But the Angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doores, and brought them
b.ACT.5.2	And kept backe part of the price, his wife also being priuy to it, and brought
b.ACT.5.20	Goe, stand and speake in the
b.ACT.5.21	And when they heard that, they entred into the
b.ACT.5.22	But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned,
b.ACT.5.23	Saying, The prison truely found we shut with all safety, and the keepers
b.ACT.5.24	Now when the high Priest, and the captaine of the
b.ACT.5.25	Then came one, and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison,
b.ACT.5.26	Then went the captaine with the officers, and brought them without violence:
b.ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the Councill, and the
b.ACT.5.28	Saying, Did not wee straitly command you, that you should not teach in this
b.ACT.5.29	Then Peter, and the other Apostles answered, and saide, Wee ought to obey God
b.ACT.5.3	But Peter said, Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy
b.ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised vp Iesus, whom yee slew and hanged on a tree.
b.ACT.5.31	Him hath God exalted with his right hand to bee a Prince and a Sauiour, for
b.ACT.5.32	And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the holy Ghost, whom
b.ACT.5.33	When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and tooke counsell to slay
b.ACT.5.34	Then stood there vp one in the Councill, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a
b.ACT.5.35	And said vnto them, Yee men of Israel, take heed to your selues, what ye
b.ACT.5.36	For before these dayes rose vp Theudas, boasting himselfe to be some body, to
b.ACT.5.37	After this man rose vp Iudas of Galilee, in the dayes of the taxing, and drew
b.ACT.5.38	And now I say vnto you, refraine from these men, and let them alone: for if
b.ACT.5.39	But if it be of God, ye cannot ouerthrow it, lest haply yee be found euen to
b.ACT.5.4	Whiles it remained, was it not thine owne? and after it was sold, was it not
b.ACT.5.40	And to him they agreed: and when they had called the Apostles, and beaten
b.ACT.5.41	And they departed from the presence of the Councill, reioycing that they were
b.ACT.5.42	And dayly in the
b.ACT.5.5	And Ananias hearing these words, fell downe, and gaue vp the ghost: and great
b.ACT.5.6	And the yong men arose, wound him vp, and caried him out, and buried him.
b.ACT.5.7	And it was about the space of three houres after, when his wife, not knowing
b.ACT.5.8	And Peter answered vnto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And
b.ACT.5.9	Then Peter saide vnto her, How is it that ye haue agreed together, to tempt
b.ACT.6.1	And in those dayes when the number of the Disciples was multiplied, there
b.ACT.6.10	And they were not able to resist the wisedome and the spirit by which he
b.ACT.6.11	Then they suborned men which said, We haue heard him speake blasphemous words
b.ACT.6.12	And they stirred vp the people, and the Elders, and the Scribes, and came
b.ACT.6.13	And set vp false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speake
b.ACT.6.14	For we haue heard him say, that this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
b.ACT.6.15	And all that sate in the Councell, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as
b.ACT.6.2	Then the twelue called the multitude of the disciples vnto them, and said, It
b.ACT.6.3	Wherefore brethren, looke ye out among you seuen men of honest report, full of
b.ACT.6.4	But we will giue our selues continually to prayer, and to the ministerie of
b.ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Steuen, a man full
b.ACT.6.6	Whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had praied, they layd their
b.ACT.6.7	And the word of God encreased, and the number of the Disciples multiplied in
b.ACT.6.8	And Steuen full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the
b.ACT.6.9	Then there arose certaine of the Synagogue, which is called the Synagogue of
b.ACT.7.1	Then said the high Priest, Are these things so?
b.ACT.7.10	And deliuered him out of all his afflictions, and gaue him fauour and
b.ACT.7.11	Now there came a dearth ouer all the
b.ACT.7.12	But when Iacob heard that there was corne in
b.ACT.7.13	And at the second time Ioseph was made knowen to his brethren, and Iosephs
b.ACT.7.14	Then sent Ioseph, and called his father Iacob to him, and all his kinred,
b.ACT.7.15	So Iacob went downe into
b.ACT.7.16	And were caried ouer into Sichem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham
b.ACT.7.17	But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworne to Abraham,
b.ACT.7.18	Till another king arose, which knew not Ioseph.
b.ACT.7.19	The same dealt subtilly with our kinred, and euill intreated our fathers, so
b.ACT.7.2	And hee said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared
b.ACT.7.20	In which time Moses was borne, and was exceeding faire, and nourished vp in
b.ACT.7.21	And when he was cast out, Pharaohs daughter tooke him vp, and nourished him
b.ACT.7.22	And Moses was learned in all the wisedome of the Egyptians, and was mightie
b.ACT.7.23	And when he was full forty yeres old, it came into his heart to visit his
b.ACT.7.24	And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and auenged him that
b.ACT.7.25	For he supposed his brethren would haue vnderstood, how that God by his hand
b.ACT.7.26	And the next day he shewed himselfe vnto them as they stroue, and would haue
b.ACT.7.27	But hee that did his neighbour wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee
b.ACT.7.28	Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
b.ACT.7.29	Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the
b.ACT.7.3	And said vnto him, Get thee out of thy countrey, and from thy kinred, and come
b.ACT.7.30	And when fourtie yeeres were expired, there appeared to him in the wildernes
b.ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it, he wondred at the sight: and as he drew neere to behold
b.ACT.7.32	Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of
b.ACT.7.33	Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shooes from thy feet: for the place
b.ACT.7.34	I haue seene, I haue seene the affliction of my people which is in
b.ACT.7.35	This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a Iudge? the
b.ACT.7.36	He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signes in the
b.ACT.7.37	This is that Moses which said vnto the children of
b.ACT.7.38	This is he that was in ye Church in the wildernesse with the Angel, which
b.ACT.7.39	To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their
b.ACT.7.4	Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from
b.ACT.7.40	Saying vnto Aaron, Make vs gods to goe before vs. For as for this Moses,
b.ACT.7.41	And they made a calfe in those dayes, and offered sacrifice vnto the idole,
b.ACT.7.42	Then God turned, and gaue them vp to worship the hoste of heauen, as it is
b.ACT.7.43	Yea, ye tooke vp the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of your God Remphan,
b.ACT.7.44	Our fathers had the Tabernacle of witnesse in the wildernesse, as hee had
b.ACT.7.45	Which also our fathers that came after, brought in with Iesus into the
b.ACT.7.46	Who found fauour before God, and desired to find a Tabernacle for the God of
b.ACT.7.47	But Solomon built him an house.
b.ACT.7.48	Howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the
b.ACT.7.49	Heauen is my throne, and earth is my footestoole: What house will ye build
b.ACT.7.5	And he gaue him none inheritance in it, no not so much as to set his foote on:
b.ACT.7.50	Hath not my hand made all these things?
b.ACT.7.51	Ye stifnecked and vncircumcised in heart, and eares, ye doe alwayes resist
b.ACT.7.52	Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers persecuted? And they haue slaine
b.ACT.7.53	Who haue receiued the Lawe by the disposition of Angels, and haue not kept
b.ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on
b.ACT.7.55	But hee being full of the holy Ghost, looked vp stedfastly into heauen, and
b.ACT.7.56	And said, Behold, I see the heauens opened, and the Sonne of man standing on
b.ACT.7.57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their eares, and ran vpon
b.ACT.7.58	And cast him out of the citie, and stoned him: and the witnesses layd downe
b.ACT.7.59	And they stoned Steuen, calling vpon God, and saying, Lord Iesus receiue my
b.ACT.7.6	And God spake on this wise, that his seede should soiourne in a strange land,
b.ACT.7.60	And he kneeled downe, and cried with a loud voice, Lord lay not this sinne to
b.ACT.7.7	And the nation to whom they shal bee in bondage, will I iudge, saide God: And
b.ACT.7.8	And he gaue him the couenant of Circumcision: and so Abraham begate Isaac, and
b.ACT.7.9	And the Patriarchs moued with enuie, sold Ioseph into
b.ACT.8.1	And Saul was consenting vnto his death. And at that time there was a great
b.ACT.8.10	To whom they all gaue heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man
b.ACT.8.11	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them
b.ACT.8.12	But when they beleeued Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdome of
b.ACT.8.13	Then Simon himselfe beleeued also: and when hee was baptized, hee continued
b.ACT.8.14	Now when the Apostles which were at Hierusalem, heard that
b.ACT.8.15	Who when they were come downe, praied for them that they might receiue the
b.ACT.8.16	(For as yet hee was fallen vpon none of them: onely they were baptized in the
b.ACT.8.17	Then layde they their hands on them, and they receiued the holy Ghost.
b.ACT.8.18	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles hands, the holy

b.ACT.8.20	But Peter said vnto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast
b.ACT.8.21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in
b.ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this thy wickednesse, and pray God, if perhaps the
b.ACT.8.23	For I perceiue that thou art in the gall of bitternesse, and in the bond of
b.ACT.8.24	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for mee, that none of
b.ACT.8.25	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned
b.ACT.8.26	And the Angel of the Lord spake vnto Philip, saying, Arise, and goe toward
b.ACT.8.27	And hee arose, and went: and behold, a man of
b.ACT.8.28	Was returning, and sitting in his charet, read Esaias the Prophet.
b.ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit saide vnto Philip, Goe neere, and ioyne thy selfe to this
b.ACT.8.3	As for Saul, he made hauocke of the Church, entring into euery house, and
b.ACT.8.30	And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, and
b.ACT.8.31	And hee said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired
b.ACT.8.32	The place of the Scripture, which hee read, was this, Hee was led as a sheepe
b.ACT.8.33	In his humiliation, his Iudgement was taken away: and who shall declare his
b.ACT.8.34	And the Eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the
b.ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached
b.ACT.8.36	And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water: and the
b.ACT.8.37	And Philip said, If thou beleeuest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he
b.ACT.8.38	And he commanded the charet to stand still: and they went downe both into the
b.ACT.8.39	And when they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught
b.ACT.8.4	Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went euery where preaching the
b.ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing thorow he preached in all the
b.ACT.8.5	Then Philip went downe to the citie of
b.ACT.8.6	And the people with one accord gaue heed vnto those things which Philip spake,
b.ACT.8.7	For vncleane spirits, crying with lowd voyce, came out of many that were
b.ACT.8.8	And there was great ioy in that citie.
b.ACT.8.9	But there was a certaine man called Simon, which before time in the same citie
b.ACT.9.1	And Saul yet breathing out threatnings &amp; slaughter against the disciples
b.ACT.9.10	And there was a certaine disciple at
b.ACT.9.11	And the Lord said vnto him, Arise, and goe into the street, which is called
b.ACT.9.12	And hath seene in a vision a man named Ananias, comming in, and putting his
b.ACT.9.13	Then Ananias answered, Lord, I haue heard by many of this man, how much euill
b.ACT.9.14	And here he hath authoritic from the chiefe Priests, to binde all that call
b.ACT.9.15	But the Lord said vnto him, Goe thy way: for hee is a chosen vessell vnto me,
b.ACT.9.16	For I will shew him how great things hee must suffer for my Names sake.
b.ACT.9.17	And Ananias went his way, and entred into the house, and putting his hands on
b.ACT.9.18	And immediatly there fell from his eyes as it had bene scales, and he
b.ACT.9.19	And when hee had receiued meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certaine
b.ACT.9.2	And desired of him letters to Damascus, to the Synagogues, that if hee found
b.ACT.9.20	And straightway hee preached Christ in the Synagogues, that hee is the Sonne
b.ACT.9.21	But all that heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed
b.ACT.9.22	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Iewes which dwelt
b.ACT.9.23	And after that many dayes were fulfilled, the Iewes tooke counsel to kill
b.ACT.9.24	But their laying awaite was knowen of Saul: and they watched the gates day
b.ACT.9.25	Then the disciples tooke him by night, and let him downe by the wall in a
b.ACT.9.26	And when Saul was come to Hierusalem, he assayed to ioyne himselfe to the
b.ACT.9.27	But Barnabas tooke him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared vnto
b.ACT.9.28	And he was with them comming in, and going out at Hierusalem.
b.ACT.9.29	And he spake boldly in the Name of the Lord Iesus, and disputed against the
b.ACT.9.3	And as he iourneyed he came neere
b.ACT.9.30	Which when the brethren knewe, they brought him downe to Cesarea, and sent
b.ACT.9.31	Then had the Churches rest thorowout all Iudea, and Galilee, and
b.ACT.9.32	And it came to passe, as Peter passed thorowout all quarters, he came downe
b.ACT.9.33	And there he found a certaine man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight
b.ACT.9.34	And Peter said vnto him, Aeneas, Iesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and
b.ACT.9.35	And all that dwelt at Lydda, and Saron, saw him, and turned to the Lord.
b.ACT.9.36	Now there was at Ioppa a certain disciple, named Tabitha, which by
b.ACT.9.37	And it came to passe in those dayes that she was sicke, and died: whome when

b.AMOS.7.4	Thus hath the Lord God shewed vnto me; and behold, the Lord God called to

b.AMOS.7.6	The Lord repented for this. This also shall not bee, saith the Lord God.
b.AMOS.7.7	Thus hee shewed mee, and behold, the Lord stood vpon a wall made by a

b.AMOS.7.9	And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the Sanctuaries of Israel
b.AMOS.8.1	Thus hath the Lord God shewed vnto me, and beholde, a basket of Summer fruit.
b.AMOS.8.10	And I will turne your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into

b.COL.2.3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisedome, and knowledge.
b.COL.2.4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with entising words.

b.DAN.11.12	And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted vp: and
b.DAN.11.13	For the King of the North shall returne, and shall set forth a multitude
b.DAN.11.14	And in those times there shall many stand vp against the King of the South:
b.DAN.11.15	So the King of the North shall come, and cast vp a mount, and take the most
b.DAN.11.16	But he that commeth against him, shall doe according to his owne will, and
b.DAN.11.17	He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdome
b.DAN.11.18	After this shall he turne his face vnto the yles, and shall take many, but a
b.DAN.11.19	Then he shall turne his face towards the fort of his owne lande: but he shall
b.DAN.1.12	Proue thy seruants, I beseech thee, ten dayes, and let them giue pulse to
b.DAN.11.2	And now will I shew thee the trueth. Behold, there shall stand vp yet three
b.DAN.11.20	Then shall stand vp in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the
b.DAN.11.21	And in his estate shall stand vp a vile person, to whom they shal not giue
b.DAN.11.22	And with the armes of a flood shall they bee ouerflowen from before him, and
b.DAN.11.23	And after the league made with him he shall worke deceitfully, for hee shall
b.DAN.11.24	He shall enter peaceably euen vpon the fattest places of the prouince, and he
b.DAN.11.25	And he shall stirre vp his power, and his courage against the king of the
b.DAN.11.26	Yea they that feede of the portion of his meate, shall destroy him, and his
b.DAN.11.27	And both these kings hearts shall be to doe mischiefe, and they shall speake
b.DAN.11.28	Then shall hee returne into his land with great riches, and his heart shall
b.DAN.11.29	At the time appointed he shall returne, and come toward the South: but it
b.DAN.1.13	Then let our countenances be looked vpon before thee, and the countenance of
b.DAN.11.3	And a mighty King shal stand vp, that shall rule with great dominion, and doe
b.DAN.11.30	For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be
b.DAN.11.31	And armes shal stand on his part, and they shall pollute the Sanctuarie of
b.DAN.11.32	And such as doe wickedly against the couenant, shall he corrupt by
b.DAN.11.33	And they that vnderstand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall
b.DAN.11.34	Now when they shall fall, they shalbe holpen with a litle help: but many
b.DAN.11.35	And some of them of vnderstanding shall fall, to trie them, and to purge, and
b.DAN.11.36	And the king shall doe according to his will, and he shall exalt himselfe,
b.DAN.11.37	Neither shall hee regard the god of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor
b.DAN.11.38	But in his estate shall he honour the god of forces: and a God whome his
b.DAN.11.39	Thus shall hee doe in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall
b.DAN.1.14	So hee consented to them in this matter, and proued them ten dayes.
b.DAN.11.4	And when he shall stand vp, his kingdome shall be broken, and shall be diuided
b.DAN.11.40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the South push at him, and the
b.DAN.11.41	He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countreys shall be
b.DAN.11.42	He shall stretch foorth his hand also vpon the countreys, and the land of
b.DAN.11.43	But he shall haue power ouer the treasures of gold and of siluer, and ouer
b.DAN.11.44	But tidings out of the East, and out of the North shall trouble him:
b.DAN.11.45	And hee shall plant the tabernacles of his palace betweene the seas in the
b.DAN.1.15	And at the end often dayes, their countenances appeared fairer, and fatter in
b.DAN.11.5	And the King of the South shall be strong, and one of his princes, and he
b.DAN.1.16	Thus Melzar tooke away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they
b.DAN.11.6	And in the end of yeeres they shall ioyne themselues together: for the Kings
b.DAN.1.17	As for these foure children, God gaue them knowledge, and skil in all
b.DAN.11.7	But out of a branch of her rootes shall one stand vp in his estate, which
b.DAN.1.18	Now at the end of the dayes that the King had said he should bring them in,
b.DAN.11.8	And shall also carie captiues into Egypt their gods with their princes, and
b.DAN.1.19	And the King communed with them: and among them all was found none like
b.DAN.11.9	So the King of the South shall come into his kingdome, and shall returne into
b.DAN.1.2	And the Lord gaue Iehoiakim king of Iudah into his hand, with part of the
b.DAN.1.20	And in all matters of wisedome and vnderstanding that the king enquired of
b.DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued euen vnto the first yeere of king Cyrus.
b.DAN.12.1	And at that time shall Michael stand vp, the great Prince which standeth for
b.DAN.12.10	Many shalbe purified, and made white and tried: but the wicked shall doe
b.DAN.12.11	And from the time that the dayly sacrifice shalbe taken away, and the
b.DAN.12.12	Blessed is he that waiteth, and commeth to the thousand, three hundred and
b.DAN.12.13	But goe thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in the
b.DAN.12.2	And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
b.DAN.12.3	And they that be wise shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament, and
b.DAN.12.4	But thou, O Daniel, shut vp the wordes, and seale the booke euen to the time
b.DAN.12.5	Then I Daniel looked, and behold, there stood other two, the one on this side
b.DAN.12.6	And one said to the man clothed in linnen, which was vpon the waters of the
b.DAN.12.7	And I heard the man clothed in linnen, which was vpon the waters of the riuer,
b.DAN.12.8	And I heard, but I vnderstood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shalbe the end
b.DAN.12.9	And he said, Goe thy way, Daniel: for the wordes are closed vp and sealed till
b.DAN.1.3	And the king spake vnto Ashpenaz the master of his Eunuches, that he should
b.DAN.1.4	Children in whom was no blemish, but well fauoured, and skilfull in all
b.DAN.1.5	And the King appointed them a daily prouision of the kings meat, and of the
b.DAN.1.6	Now among these were of the children of Iudah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
b.DAN.1.7	Unto whom the Prince of the Eunuches gaue names: for he gaue vnto daniel the
b.DAN.1.8	But Daniel purposed in his heart, that he would not defile himselfe with the
b.DAN.1.9	Now God had brought Daniel into fauour and tender loue with the Prince of the
b.DAN.2.1	And in the second yeere of the reigne of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchad-nezzar
b.DAN.2.10	The Caldeans answered before the King, and said, There is not a man vpon the
b.DAN.2.11	And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that
b.DAN.2.12	For this cause the King was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy
b.DAN.2.13	And the decree went foorth that the wise men should be slaine, and they
b.DAN.2.14	Then Daniel answered with counsell and wisedome to Arioch the captaine of the
b.DAN.2.15	Hee answered and said to Arioch the Kings captaine, Why is the decree so
b.DAN.2.16	Then Daniel went in and desired of the King, that hee would giue him time,
b.DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing knowen to Hananiah, Mishael,
b.DAN.2.18	That they would desire mercies of the God of heauen concerning this secret,
b.DAN.2.19	Then was the secret reuealed vnto Daniel in a night vision: then Daniel
b.DAN.2.2	Then the King commanded to call the Magicians, and the Astrologers, and the
b.DAN.2.20	Daniel answered and said; Blessed be the name of God for euer and euer: for
b.DAN.2.21	And he changeth the times and the seasons: he remoueth Kings, and setteth vp
b.DAN.2.22	He reuealeth the deepe and secret things: hee knoweth what is in the darknes,
b.DAN.2.23	I thanke thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast giuen me
b.DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went in vnto Arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy
b.DAN.2.25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, &amp; said thus vnto
b.DAN.2.26	The King answered and said to Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou
b.DAN.2.27	Daniel answered in the presence of the King, and said, The secret which the
b.DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heauen that reuealeth secrets, and maketh knowen to the
b.DAN.2.29	As for thee, O King, thy thoughts came into thy minde vpon thy bed, what
b.DAN.2.3	And the King said vnto them, I haue dreamed a dreame, and my spirit was
b.DAN.2.30	But as for me, this secret is not reuealed to me, for any wisdome that I haue
b.DAN.2.31	Thou, O King, sawest, and behold a great image: this great image whose
b.DAN.2.32	This images head was of fine gold, his breast and his armes of siluer, his
b.DAN.2.33	His legs of yron, his feete part of yron, and part of clay.
b.DAN.2.34	Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the
b.DAN.2.35	Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer, and the golde broken to
b.DAN.2.36	This is the dreame, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the
b.DAN.2.37	Thou, O King, art a king of Kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a
b.DAN.2.38	And wheresoeuer the children of men dwel, the beasts of the field, and the
b.DAN.2.39	And after thee shall arise an other kingdome inferiour to thee, and another
b.DAN.2.4	Then spake the Caldeans to the King in Syriacke; O king, liue for euer: tell
b.DAN.2.40	And the fourth kingdome shall be strong as yron: forasmuch as yron breaketh
b.DAN.2.41	And whereas thou sawest the feete and toes, part of potters clay, and part of
b.DAN.2.42	And as the toes of the feete were part of yron, and part of clay; so the
b.DAN.2.43	And whereas thou sawest yron mixt with myrie clay, they shall mingle
b.DAN.2.44	And in the daies of these Kings shall the God of heauen set vp a kingdome,
b.DAN.2.45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountaine without
b.DAN.2.46	Then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell vpon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and
b.DAN.2.47	The King answered vnto Daniel and said, Of a trueth it is, that your God is a
b.DAN.2.48	Then the King made Daniel a great man, and gaue him many great gifts, &amp;
b.DAN.2.49	Then Daniel requested of the King, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
b.DAN.2.5	The King answered, and said to the Caldeans, The thing is gone from mee: if ye
b.DAN.2.6	But if yee shewe the dreame, and the interpretation thereof, yee shall receiue
b.DAN.2.7	They answered againe, and said, Let the King tell his seruants the dreame, and
b.DAN.2.8	The King answered, and said, I know of certeinty that ye would gaine the time,
b.DAN.2.9	But if yee will not make knowen vnto me the dreame, there is but one decree
b.DAN.3.1	Nebuchad-nezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore
b.DAN.3.10	Thou, O King, hast made a decree, that euery man that shal heare the sound of
b.DAN.3.11	And who so falleth not downe &amp; worshippeth, that he should be cast into
b.DAN.3.12	There are certain Iewes whom thou hast set ouer the affaires of the prouince
b.DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchad-nezzar in his rage and furie commaunded to bring Shadrach,
b.DAN.3.14	Nebuchad-nezzar spake and said vnto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach and
b.DAN.3.15	Now if ye be ready that at what time yee heare the sound of the cornet,
b.DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king; O
b.DAN.3.17	If it be so, our God whom wee serue, is able to deliuer vs from the burning
b.DAN.3.18	But if not, bee it knowen vnto thee, O king, that we will not serue thy gods,
b.DAN.3.19	Then was Nebuchad-nezzar full of furie, and the forme of his visage was
b.DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchad-nezzar the king sent to gather together the Princes, the
b.DAN.3.20	And hee commaunded the most mighty men that were in his armie, to binde
b.DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their coates, their hosen, and their hats, and
b.DAN.3.22	Therefore because the Kings commandement was vrgent, and the furnace
b.DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell downe bound into
b.DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchad-nezzar the king was astonied, and rose vp in haste, and spake
b.DAN.3.25	He answered and said, Loe, I see foure men loose, walking in the midst of the
b.DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchad-nezzar came neere to the mouth of the burning fierie furnace,
b.DAN.3.27	And the princes, gouernours, and captaines, and the kings counsellers, being
b.DAN.3.28	Then Nebuchad-nezzar spake and said; Blessed bee the God of Shadrach, Meshach,
b.DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, That euery people, nation, and language, which
b.DAN.3.3	Then the Princes, the Gouernours and Captaines, the Iudges, the Treasurers,
b.DAN.3.30	Then the King promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the prouince of
b.DAN.3.4	Then an herauld cryed aloud, To you it is commaunded, O people, nations, and
b.DAN.3.5	That at what time yee heare the sound of the cornet, flute, harpe, sackbut,
b.DAN.3.6	And who so falleth not down and worshippeth, shall the same houre bee cast
b.DAN.3.7	Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet,
b.DAN.3.8	Wherefore at that time certaine Caldeans came neere, and accused the Iewes.
b.DAN.3.9	They spake and sayd to the King Nebuchad-nezzar, O King, liue for euer.
b.DAN.4.1	Nebuchad-nezzar the king, vnto all people, nations, and languages that dwell
b.DAN.4.10	Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in
b.DAN.4.11	The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached vnto heauen,
b.DAN.4.12	The leaues thereof were faire, and the fruite thereof much, and in it was
b.DAN.4.13	I sawe in the visions of my head vpon my bed, &amp; behold, a watcher and an
b.DAN.4.14	He cryed aloude, and said thus; Hew downe the tree, and cut off his branches;
b.DAN.4.15	Neuerthelesse leaue the stumpe of his rootes in the earth, euen with a band
b.DAN.4.16	Let his heart bee changed from mans, and let a beasts heart be giuen vnto
b.DAN.4.17	This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demaund by the word of
b.DAN.4.18	This dreame, I king Nebuchadnezzar haue seene: Now thou, O Belteshazzar,
b.DAN.4.19	Then Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar) was astonied for one houre, and his
b.DAN.4.2	I thought it good to shew the signes, and wonders, that the high God hath
b.DAN.4.20	The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached
b.DAN.4.21	Whose leaues were faire, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meate for
b.DAN.4.22	It is thou, O King, that art growen and become strong: for thy greatnesse is
b.DAN.4.23	And whereas the King saw a watcher, and an holy one comming downe from heauen,
b.DAN.4.24	This is the interpretation, O king, &amp; this is the decree of the most Hie,
b.DAN.4.25	That they shall driue thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the
b.DAN.4.26	And whereas they commanded to leaue the stumpe of the tree rootes; thy
b.DAN.4.27	Wherefore, O King, let my counsell be acceptable vnto thee, and breake off
b.DAN.4.28	All this came vpon the King Nebuchad-nezzar.
b.DAN.4.29	At the end of twelue moneths he walked in the palace of the kingdome of
b.DAN.4.3	How great are his signes? and how mighty are his wonders? his kingdome is an
b.DAN.4.30	The King spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I haue built for
b.DAN.4.31	While the word was in the Kings mouth, there fell a voice from heauen,
b.DAN.4.32	And they shall driue thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts
b.DAN.4.33	The same houre was the thing fulfilled vpon Nebuchad-nezzar, and he was
b.DAN.4.34	And at the end of the dayes, I Nebuchad-nezzar lift vp mine eyes vnto heauen,
b.DAN.4.35	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and hee doth
b.DAN.4.36	At the same time my reason returned vnto me, and for the glory of my kingdome,
b.DAN.4.37	Now I Nebuchad-nezzar praise, and extoll and honour the King of heauen, all
b.DAN.4.4	I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace.
b.DAN.4.5	I saw a dreame which made me afraid, and the thoughts vpon my bed, and the
b.DAN.4.6	Therefore made I a decree, to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before mee,
b.DAN.4.7	Then came in the Magicians, the Astrologers, the Caldeans, and the Southsayers:
b.DAN.4.8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, (whose name was Belteshazzar,
b.DAN.4.9	O Belteshazzar, master of the Magicians, because I know that the spirit of the
b.DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the King made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords, and dranke
b.DAN.5.10	Now the queene, by reason of the wordes of the king and his lords, came into
b.DAN.5.11	There is a man in thy kingdom, in whome is the spirit of the holy gods, and
b.DAN.5.12	Forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and vnderstanding,
b.DAN.5.13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king, and the king spake and said vnto
b.DAN.5.14	I haue euen heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that
b.DAN.5.15	And now the wise men, the astrologers haue bene brought in before me, that
b.DAN.5.16	And I haue heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolue
b.DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thy selfe,
b.DAN.5.18	O thou king, the most high God gaue Nebuchad-nezzar thy father a kingdome,
b.DAN.5.19	And for the maiestie that hee gaue him, all people, nations, and languages
b.DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commaunded to bring the golden and
b.DAN.5.20	But when his heart was lifted vp, and his minde hardened in pride: hee was
b.DAN.5.21	And hee was driuen from the sonnes of men, and his heart was made like the
b.DAN.5.22	And thou his sonne, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou
b.DAN.5.23	But hast lifted vp thy selfe against the Lord of heauen, and they haue
b.DAN.5.24	Then was the part of the hand sent from him, and this writing was written.
b.DAN.5.25	And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL VPHARSIN.
b.DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the thing, MENE, God hath numbred thy kingdome,
b.DAN.5.27	TEKEL, thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
b.DAN.5.28	PERES, thy kingdome is diuided, and giuen to the Medes and Persians.
b.DAN.5.29	Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a
b.DAN.5.3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the
b.DAN.5.30	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Caldeans slaine.
b.DAN.5.31	And Darius the Median tooke the kingdome, being about threescore and two
b.DAN.5.4	They drunke wine, and praised the gods of gold and of siluer, of brasse, of
b.DAN.5.5	In the same houre came forth fingers of a mans hand, and wrote ouer against
b.DAN.5.6	Then the kings countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that
b.DAN.5.7	The king cried aloud to bring in the Astrologers, the Caldeans, and the
b.DAN.5.8	Then came in all the kings wise men, but they could not reade the writing, nor
b.DAN.5.9	Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in
b.DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to set ouer the kingdome an hundred and twenty Princes,
b.DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, hee went into his house,
b.DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying, and making supplication
b.DAN.6.12	Then they came neere, and spake before the king concerning the kings decree;
b.DAN.6.13	Then answered they and said before the king; That Daniel which is of the
b.DAN.6.14	Then the king, when hee heard these wordes, was sore displeased with himselfe,
b.DAN.6.15	Then these men assembled vnto the king, and said vnto the king, Know O king,
b.DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the denne
b.DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought and laid vpon the mouth of the denne, and the King
b.DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were
b.DAN.6.19	Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste vnto the den
b.DAN.6.2	And ouer these, three Presidents, (of whom Daniel was first) that the Princes
b.DAN.6.20	And when he came to the den, he cryed with a lamentable voice vnto Daniel,
b.DAN.6.21	Then said Daniel vnto the king, O king, liue for euer.
b.DAN.6.22	My God hath sent his Angel, and hath shut the lyons mouthes that they haue
b.DAN.6.23	Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take
b.DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel,
b.DAN.6.25	Then king Darius wrote vnto all people, nations, and languages that dwell in
b.DAN.6.26	I make a decree, That in euery dominion of my kingdome, men tremble and feare
b.DAN.6.27	He deliuereth and rescueth, and he worketh signes and wonders in heauen and
b.DAN.6.28	So this Daniel prospered in the reigne of Darius, and in the reigne of Cyrus
b.DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel was preferred aboue the Presidents, and Princes, because an
b.DAN.6.4	Then the Presidents and Princes sought to finde occasion against Daniel
b.DAN.6.5	Then said these men, We shall not finde any occasion against this Daniel,
b.DAN.6.6	Then these Presidents and Princes assembled together to the king, and said
b.DAN.6.7	All the Presidents of the kingdome, the gouernours, and the Princes, the
b.DAN.6.8	Now, O king, establish the decree, and signe the writing, that it be not
b.DAN.6.9	Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree.
b.DAN.7.1	In the first yeere of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dreame, and
b.DAN.7.10	A fierie streame issued, and came foorth from before him: thousand thousands
b.DAN.7.11	I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horne spake:
b.DAN.7.12	As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet
b.DAN.7.13	I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the sonne of man, came with
b.DAN.7.14	And there was giuen him dominion and glory, and a kingdome, that all people,
b.DAN.7.15	I Daniel was grieued in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of
b.DAN.7.16	I came neere vnto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all
b.DAN.7.17	These great beasts, which are foure, are foure Kings, which shall arise out
b.DAN.7.18	But the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdome, &amp; possesse the
b.DAN.7.19	Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diuerse from al
b.DAN.7.2	Daniel spake, and said, I saw in my vision by night, &amp; behold, the foure
b.DAN.7.20	And of the ten hornes that were in his head, and of the other, which came vp,
b.DAN.7.21	I beheld, and the same horne made warre with the Saints, and preuailed
b.DAN.7.22	Untill the Ancient of daies came, and iudgment was giuen to the Saints of the
b.DAN.7.23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdome vpon earth, which
b.DAN.7.24	And the tenne hornes out of this kingdome are tenne Kings that shall arise:
b.DAN.7.25	And he shall speake great words against the most high, and shall weare out
b.DAN.7.26	But the iudgement shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
b.DAN.7.27	And the kingdome and dominion, and the greatnesse of the kingdome vnder the
b.DAN.7.28	Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much
b.DAN.7.3	And foure great beastes came vp from the sea, diuers one from another.
b.DAN.7.4	The first was like a Lyon, and had Eagles wings: I beheld till the wings
b.DAN.7.5	And behold, another beast, a second, like to a Beare, and it raised vp it
b.DAN.7.6	After this I beheld, and loe, another like a Leopard, which had vpon the backe
b.DAN.7.7	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadfull
b.DAN.7.8	I considered the hornes, and behold, there came vp among them another little
b.DAN.7.9	I beheld till the thrones were cast downe, and the Ancient of dayes did sit,
b.DAN.8.1	In the third yeere of the reigne of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared vnto
b.DAN.8.10	And it waxed great euen to the hoste of heauen, and it cast downe some of the

b.DAN.8.16	And I heard a mans voyce betweene the bankes of Ulai, which called and said,
b.DAN.8.17	So he came neere where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell vpon
b.DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deepe sleepe on my face toward the

b.DAN.8.26	And the vision of the euening, and the morning, which was tolde, is true:
b.DAN.8.27	And I Daniel fainted and was sicke certaine dayes: afterward I rose vp and
b.DAN.8.3	Then I lifted vp mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the riuer,
b.DAN.8.4	I saw the ramme pushing Westward, &amp; Northward, and Southward: so that no

b.DAN.9.14	Therefore hath the Lord watched vpon the euil, and brought it vpon vs: for
b.DAN.9.15	And now O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of
b.DAN.9.16	O Lord, according to all thy righteousnes, I beseech thee, let thine anger

b.DAN.9.27	And hee shall confirme the couenant with many for one weeke: and in the midst
b.DAN.9.3	And I set my face vnto the Lord God to seeke by prayer, and supplications,
b.DAN.9.4	And I prayed vnto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said; O Lord,
b.DAN.9.5	We haue sinned, and haue committed iniquitie, and haue done wickedly, and haue
b.DAN.9.6	Neither haue we hearkened vnto thy seruants the Prophets, which spake in thy

b.DEU.10.10	And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, fortie dayes, and
b.DEU.10.11	And the Lord said vnto me, Arise, take thy iourney before the people, that
b.DEU.10.12	And now Israel, what doeth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare the
b.DEU.10.13	To keepe the Commandements of the Lord, and his Statutes, which I commaund
b.DEU.10.14	Behold, the heauen, &amp; the heauen of heauens is the Lords thy God, the

b.DEU.10.16	Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and bee no more stiffenecked.
b.DEU.10.17	For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a

b.DEU.10.2	And I will write on the Tables the words that were in the first Tables which
b.DEU.10.20	Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serue, and to him shalt

b.DEU.10.3	And I made an Arke of Shittim wood, and hewed two Tables of stone like vnto
b.DEU.10.4	And he wrote on the Tables, according to the first writing, the tenne
b.DEU.10.5	And I turned my selfe and came downe from the mount, and put the Tables in the

b.DEU.11.17	And then the Lords wrath be kindled against you, and hee shut vp the heauen,
b.DEU.11.18	Therefore shall ye lay vp these my words in your heart, and in your soule,
b.DEU.11.19	And ye shal teach them your children, speaking of them, when thou sittest in
b.DEU.1.12	How can I my selfe alone beare your cumbrance, and your burden, and your

b.DEU.11.25	There shall no man bee able to stand before you: for the Lord your God shall

b.DEU.1.14	And ye answered me, and saide, The thing which thou hast spoken, is good for
b.DEU.11.4	And what hee did vnto the army of Egypt, vnto their horses, and to their
b.DEU.1.15	So I tooke the chiefe of your tribes, wise men, and knowen, and made them
b.DEU.11.5	And what hee did vnto you in the wildernesse, vntill yee came into this place,
b.DEU.1.16	And I charged your Iudges at that time, saying, Heare the causes betweene

b.DEU.1.18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should doe.
b.DEU.11.8	Therefore shall yee keepe all the Commandements which I command you this day,
b.DEU.1.19	And when wee departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible
b.DEU.11.9	And that yee may prolong your dayes in the lande which the Lord sware vnto
b.DEU.1.2	(There are eleuen daies iourney from Horeb, by the way of mount Seir, vnto
b.DEU.1.20	And I said vnto you, Ye are come vnto the mountaine of the Amorites, which

b.DEU.12.17	Thou mayest not eate within thy gates the tithe of thy corne, or of thy wine,
b.DEU.12.18	But thou must eate them before the Lord thy God, in the place which the Lord
b.DEU.12.19	Take heed to thy selfe, that thou forsake not the Leuite, as long as thou

b.DEU.12.21	If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put his Name there, be too
b.DEU.12.22	Euen as the Roe bucke and the Hart is eaten, so thou shalt eate them: the
b.DEU.12.23	Onely be sure that thou eate not the blood: for the blood is the life, and
b.DEU.12.24	Thou shalt not eate it; thou shalt powre it vpon the earth as water.
b.DEU.12.25	Thou shalt not eate it, that it may goe well with thee, and with thy children
b.DEU.12.26	Onely thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vowes, thou shalt take, and

b.DEU.12.29	When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither
b.DEU.1.23	And the saying pleased mee well: and I tooke twelue men of you, one of a

b.DEU.12.30	Take heede to thy selfe that thou be not snared by following them, after that
b.DEU.12.31	Thou shalt not doe so vnto the Lord thy God: for euery abomination to the
b.DEU.12.32	What thing soeuer I command you, obserue to doe it: thou shalt not adde
b.DEU.1.24	And they turned and went vp into the mountaine, and came vnto the valley of
b.DEU.12.4	Yee shall not doe so vnto the Lord your God.
b.DEU.1.25	And they tooke of the fruit of the land in their handes, and brought it downe
b.DEU.12.5	But vnto the place which the Lord your God shall chuse out of all your tribes,
b.DEU.1.26	Notwithstanding, ye would not goe vp, but rebelled against the commandement
b.DEU.12.6	And thither yee shall bring your burnt offrings, and your sacrifices, and your
b.DEU.1.27	And ye murmured in your tents and said, Because the Lord hated vs, he hath
b.DEU.12.7	And there ye shall eate before the Lord your God, and yee shall reioyce in all
b.DEU.1.28	Whither shall wee goe vp? our brethren haue discouraged our heart, saying,
b.DEU.12.8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we doe here this day, euery man
b.DEU.1.29	Then I said vnto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
b.DEU.12.9	For yee are not as yet come to the rest, and to the inheritance which the Lord
b.DEU.1.3	And it came to passe in the fourtieth yeere, in the eleuenth moneth, on the
b.DEU.1.30	The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according
b.DEU.1.31	And in the wildernes, where thou hast seene how that the Lord thy God bare
b.DEU.13.1	If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreames, and giueth thee a

b.DEU.13.11	And all Israel shall heare, and feare, and shall doe no more any such
b.DEU.13.12	If thou shalt heare say in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God hath
b.DEU.13.13	Certaine men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and haue
b.DEU.13.14	Then shalt thou enquire and make search, and aske diligently: and behold, if
b.DEU.13.15	Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that citie with the edge of the
b.DEU.13.16	And thou shalt gather all the spoile of it, into the midst of the street
b.DEU.13.17	And there shall cleaue nought of the cursed thing to thine hand, that the
b.DEU.13.18	When thou shalt hearken to the voyce of the Lord thy God, to keepe all his
b.DEU.1.32	Yet in this thing ye did not beleeue the Lord your God,
b.DEU.13.2	And the signe or the wonder come to passe, wherof he spake vnto thee, saying,
b.DEU.1.33	Who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents
b.DEU.13.3	Thou shalt not hearken vnto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of

b.DEU.13.4	Ye shall walke after the Lord your God, and feare him, and keepe his
b.DEU.1.35	Surely there shall not one of these men of this euill generation see that
b.DEU.13.5	And that prophet or that dreamer of dreames shalbe put to death (because hee

b.DEU.13.6	If thy brother, the sonne of thy mother, or thy sonne, or thy daughter, or the
b.DEU.1.37	Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not
b.DEU.13.7	Namely of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh vnto thee, or
b.DEU.1.38	But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall goe in
b.DEU.13.8	Thou shalt not consent vnto him nor hearken vnto him, neither shall thine eye
b.DEU.1.39	Moreouer, your litle ones, which ye said should be a pray, and your children,
b.DEU.13.9	But thou shalt surely kill him: Thine hand shall be first vpon him, to put him
b.DEU.1.4	After hee had slaine Sihon the King of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon,
b.DEU.1.40	But as for you, turne ye, and take your iourney into the wildernesse, by the
b.DEU.1.41	Then ye answered, and said vnto mee, Wee haue sinned against the Lord, we
b.DEU.14.1	Yee are the children of the Lord your God: yee shall not cutte your selues,
b.DEU.14.10	And whatsoeuer hath not sinnes and scales, ye may not eat: it is vncleane
b.DEU.14.11	Of all cleane birds ye shall eate.
b.DEU.14.12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the Eagle, and the ossifrage,
b.DEU.14.13	And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kinde,
b.DEU.14.14	And euery rauen after his kinde,
b.DEU.14.15	And the owle, &amp; the night hawke, and the cuckow, and the hawke after his
b.DEU.14.16	The little owle, and the great owle, and the swanne,
b.DEU.14.17	And the pellicane, and the Geer-eagle, and the cormorant,
b.DEU.14.18	And the Storke, and the Heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the batte.
b.DEU.14.19	And euery creeping thing that flyeth, is vncleane vnto you: they shall not be
b.DEU.1.42	And the Lord said vnto me, Say vnto them, Goe not vp, neither fight, for I am
b.DEU.14.2	For thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen
b.DEU.14.20	But of all cleane foules ye may eat.
b.DEU.14.21	Ye shall not eate of any thing that dieth of it selfe: thou shalt giue it
b.DEU.14.22	Thou shalt truely tithe all the increase of thy seede, that the field
b.DEU.14.23	And thou shalt eate before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall
b.DEU.14.24	And if the way bee too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carie it,
b.DEU.14.25	Then shalt thou turne it into money, and binde vp the money in thine hand,
b.DEU.14.26	And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after, for
b.DEU.14.27	And the Leuite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him: for he
b.DEU.14.28	At the end of three yeres thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine
b.DEU.14.29	And the Leuite, because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee, and the
b.DEU.1.43	So I spake vnto you, and you would not heare, but rebelled against the
b.DEU.14.3	Thou shalt not eate any abominable thing.
b.DEU.1.44	And the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine, came out against you, and
b.DEU.14.4	These are the beasts which yee shall eate: the oxe, the sheepe, and the goat,
b.DEU.1.45	And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken to
b.DEU.14.5	The Hart, and the Roe bucke, and the fallow deere, and the wilde goat, and the
b.DEU.1.46	So yee abode in Kadesh many dayes, according vnto the dayes that ye abode
b.DEU.14.6	And euery beast that parteth the hoofe, and cleaueth the clift into two clawes,
b.DEU.14.7	Neuerthelesse these yee shall not eate, of them that chew the cud, or of them
b.DEU.14.8	And the swine, because it diuideth the hoofe, yet cheweth not the cud, it is
b.DEU.14.9	These yee shall eate of all that are in the waters: all that haue finnes and
b.DEU.1.5	On this side Iordane, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law,
b.DEU.15.1	At the end of euery seuen yeeres thou shalt make a release.
b.DEU.15.10	Thou shalt surely giue him, and thine heart shall not bee grieued when thou
b.DEU.15.11	For the poore shall neuer cease out of the land: therefore I command thee,
b.DEU.15.12	And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold vnto thee, and
b.DEU.15.13	And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away
b.DEU.15.14	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flocke, and out of thy floore,
b.DEU.15.15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and
b.DEU.15.16	And it shall be if he say vnto thee, I will not goe away from thee, because
b.DEU.15.17	Then thou shalt take an aule, and thrust it through his eare vnto the doore,
b.DEU.15.18	It shall not seeme hard vnto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee:
b.DEU.15.19	All the firstling males that come of thy heard, and of thy flock, thou shalt
b.DEU.15.2	And this is the maner of the release: Euery creditour that lendeth ought vnto
b.DEU.15.20	Thou shalt eate it before the Lord thy God yeere by yeere, in the place which
b.DEU.15.21	And if there be any blemish therein; as if it be lame, or blinde, or haue any
b.DEU.15.22	Thou shalt eate it within thy gates: the vncleane and the cleane person shall
b.DEU.15.23	Onely thou shalt not eate the blood thereof: thou shalt powre it vpon the
b.DEU.15.3	Of a forreiner thou mayest exact it againe: but that which is thine with thy
b.DEU.15.4	Saue when there shall bee no poore among you: for the Lord shal greatly blesse
b.DEU.15.5	Onely if thou carefully hearken vnto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obserue
b.DEU.15.6	For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee, and thou shalt lend
b.DEU.15.7	If there be among you a poore man of one of thy brethren within any of thy
b.DEU.15.8	But thou shalt open thine hand wide vnto him, and shalt surely lend him
b.DEU.15.9	Beware that there bee not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seuenth

b.DEU.16.10	And thou shalt keepe the feast of weekes vnto the Lord thy God with a tribute
b.DEU.16.11	And thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy sonne, and thy
b.DEU.16.12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt
b.DEU.16.13	Thou shalt obserue the feast of Tabernacles seuen dayes, after that thou hast

b.DEU.16.15	Seuen dayes shalt thou keepe a solemne feast vnto the Lord thy God, in the
b.DEU.16.16	Three times in a yeere shal all thy males appeare before the Lord thy God, in
b.DEU.16.17	Euery man shall giue as hee is able, according to the blessing of the Lord
b.DEU.16.18	Iudges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the Lord thy
b.DEU.16.19	Thou shalt not wrest iudgement, thou shalt not respect persons, neither take
b.DEU.16.2	Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passeouer vnto the Lord thy God, of the
b.DEU.16.20	That which is altogether iust shalt thou followe, that thou mayest liue, and
b.DEU.16.21	Thou shalt not plant thee a groue of any trees neere vnto the Altar of the
b.DEU.16.22	Neither shalt thou set thee vp any image, which the Lord thy God hateth.

b.DEU.3.10	All the cities of the plaine, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, vnto Salchah,
b.DEU.3.11	For onely Og King of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his

b.DEU.31.10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of euery seuen yeeres, in the

b.DEU.3.13	And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdome of Og, gaue I vnto
b.DEU.31.3	The Lord thy God, hee will goe ouer before thee, and he will destroy these
b.DEU.31.30	And Moses spake in the eares of al the Cogregation of Israel the words of
b.DEU.3.14	Iair the sonne of Manasseh tooke all the countrey of Argob, vnto the coastes
b.DEU.31.4	And the Lord shall doe vnto them, as hee did to Sihon, and to Og Kings of the

b.DEU.31.5	And the Lord shall giue them vp before your face, that ye may doe vnto them
b.DEU.3.16	And vnto the Reubenites, and vnto the Gadites, I gaue from Gilead, euen vnto

b.DEU.31.7	And Moses called vnto Ioshua, and said vnto him in the sight of all Israel,
b.DEU.3.18	And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath giuen you
b.DEU.31.8	And the Lord, he it is that doth goe before thee, he will be with thee, hee

b.DEU.3.20	Untill the Lord haue giuen rest vnto your brethren, as well as vnto you, and
b.DEU.3.21	And I commanded Ioshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes haue seene all that

b.DEU.32.11	As an Eagle stirreth vp her nest, fluttereth ouer her yong, spreadeth abroad
b.DEU.32.12	So the Lord alone did leade him, and there was no strange God with him.
b.DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eate the
b.DEU.32.14	Butter of kine, &amp; milke of sheepe, with fat of lambes, and rammes of the
b.DEU.32.15	But Iesurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxen fat, thou art growen thicke,
b.DEU.32.16	They prouoked him to ielousie with strange gods, with abominations prouoked
b.DEU.32.17	They sacrificed vnto deuils, not to God: to gods whom they knew not, to new
b.DEU.32.18	Of the Rocke that begate thee thou art vnmindfull, and hast forgotten God
b.DEU.32.19	And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the prouoking of his
b.DEU.3.22	Ye shall not feare them: for the Lord your God, he shal fight for you.
b.DEU.32.2	My doctrine shall drop as the raine: my speech shall distill as the deaw, as
b.DEU.32.20	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their ende shall
b.DEU.32.21	They haue mooued me to ielousie with that which is not god, they haue
b.DEU.32.22	For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burne vnto the lowest hell, and
b.DEU.32.23	I will heape mischiefes vpon them, I will spend mine arrowes vpon them.
b.DEU.32.24	They shall bee burnt with hunger and deuoured with burning heat, and with
b.DEU.32.25	The sword without, and terrour within shall destroy both the yong man, and
b.DEU.32.26	I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of
b.DEU.32.27	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemie, lest their aduersaries
b.DEU.32.28	For they are a nation voide of counsel, neither is there any vnderstanding in
b.DEU.32.29	O that they were wise, that they vnderstood this, that they would consider
b.DEU.3.23	And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,
b.DEU.32.3	Because I wil publish the Name of the Lord: ascribe yee greatnesse vnto our
b.DEU.32.30	How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except
b.DEU.32.31	For their rocke is not as our Rocke, euen our enemies themselues being iudges.
b.DEU.32.32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodome, and of the fields of Gomorah: their
b.DEU.32.33	Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruell venime of Aspes.
b.DEU.32.34	Is not this laide vp in store with me, and sealed vp among my treasures?
b.DEU.32.35	To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence, their foot shall slide in due
b.DEU.32.36	For the Lord shall iudge his people, and repent himselfe for his seruants,
b.DEU.32.37	And he shall say, where are their gods? Their Rocke in whom they trusted;
b.DEU.32.38	Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, &amp; dranke the wine of their
b.DEU.32.39	See now, that I, euen I am he, and there is no god with mee; I kill, and I
b.DEU.3.24	O Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy seruant thy greatnesse, and thy
b.DEU.32.4	He is the rocke, his worke is perfect: for all his wayes are Iudgement: A God
b.DEU.32.40	For I lift vp my hand to heauen, and say, I liue for euer.
b.DEU.32.41	If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take holde on Iudgement, I will
b.DEU.32.42	I will make mine arrowes drunke with blood, (and my sword shal deuoure flesh)
b.DEU.32.43	Reioyce, O ye nations with his people, for he will auenge the blood of his
b.DEU.32.44	And Moses came and spake all the wordes of this song in the eares of the
b.DEU.32.45	And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel.
b.DEU.32.46	And hee said vnto them, Set your hearts vnto all the wordes which I testifie
b.DEU.32.47	For it is not a vaine thing for you: because it is your life, and through
b.DEU.32.48	And the Lord spake vnto Moses that selfe same day, saying,
b.DEU.32.49	Get thee vp into this mountaine Abarim, vnto mount Nebo, which is in the land
b.DEU.3.25	I pray thee let me goe ouer, and see the good land that is beyond Iordan,
b.DEU.32.5	They haue corrupted themselues, their spot is not the spot of his children:
b.DEU.32.50	And die in the mount whither thou goest vp, and bee gathered vnto thy people,
b.DEU.32.51	Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel, at the waters
b.DEU.32.52	Yet thou shalt see the land before thee, but thou shalt not goe thither vnto
b.DEU.3.26	But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not heare mee: and
b.DEU.32.6	Doe ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people, &amp; vnwise? Is not he thy
b.DEU.3.27	Get thee vp into the top of Pisgah, and lift vp thine eyes Westward, and
b.DEU.32.7	Remember the dayes of olde, consider the yeeres of many generations: aske thy
b.DEU.3.28	But charge Ioshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for hee shall goe
b.DEU.32.8	When the most High diuided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated
b.DEU.3.29	So we abode in the valley, ouer against Beth-Peor.
b.DEU.32.9	For the Lords portion is his people: Iacob is the lot of his inheritance.
b.DEU.3.3	So the Lord our God deliuered into our hands Og also the King of Bashan, and
b.DEU.33.1	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children
b.DEU.33.10	They shal teach Iacob thy iudgments, and Israel thy Lawe: they shall put
b.DEU.33.11	Blesse, Lord, his substance, and accept the worke of his handes, smite thorow
b.DEU.33.12	And of Beniamin he said, The beloued of the Lord shall dwell in safetie by
b.DEU.33.13	And of Ioseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious
b.DEU.33.14	And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sunne, and for the precious
b.DEU.33.15	And for the chiefe things of the ancient mountaines, and for the precious
b.DEU.33.16	And for the precious things of the earth, and fulnesse thereof, and for the
b.DEU.33.17	His glory is like the firstling of his bullocke, &amp; his hornes are like
b.DEU.33.18	And of Zebulun he said, Reioyce, Zebulun, in thy going out; and Issachar, in
b.DEU.33.19	They shall call the people vnto the mountaine, there they shal offer
b.DEU.33.2	And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose vp from Seir vnto them, hee

b.ECC.1.5	The Sunne also ariseth, and the Sunne goeth downe, and hasteth to the place
b.ECC.1.6	The winde goeth toward the South, and turneth about vnto the North; it
b.ECC.1.7	All the riuers runne into the sea, yet the Sea is not full: vnto the place
b.ECC.1.8	All things are full of labour, man cannot vtter it: the eye is not satisfied
b.ECC.1.9	The thing that hath beene, it is that which shall be: and that which is done,
b.ECC.2.1	I said in mine heart, Goe to now, I wil prooue thee with mirth, therfore enioy
b.ECC.2.10	And whatsoeuer mine eyes desired, I kept not from them; I withheld not my
b.ECC.2.11	Then I looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought, and on the labour
b.ECC.2.12	And I turned my selfe to behold wisedome, and madnesse and folly: for what
b.ECC.2.13	Then I saw that wisedome excelleth folly, as farre as light excelleth
b.ECC.2.14	The wise mans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in darknes: and I
b.ECC.2.15	Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the foole, so it happeneth euen
b.ECC.2.16	For there is no remembrance of the wise, more then of the foole for euer;
b.ECC.2.17	Therefore I hated life, because the worke that is wrought vnder the Sunne is
b.ECC.2.18	Yea I hated all my labour which I had taken vnder the Sunne: because I should

b.ECC.2.2	I saide of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
b.ECC.2.20	Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despaire of all the labour which
b.ECC.2.21	For there is a man whose labour is in wisedome and in knowledge, and in
b.ECC.2.22	For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart wherein
b.ECC.2.23	For all his dayes are sorrowes, and his traueile, griefe; yea his heart
b.ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man, then that he should eat and drinke, and
b.ECC.2.25	For who can eate? or who else can hasten hereunto more then I?
b.ECC.2.26	For God giueth to a man that is good in his sight, wisedome, and knowledge,
b.ECC.2.3	I sought in mine heart to giue my selfe vnto wine, (yet acquainting mine heart
b.ECC.2.4	I made me great workes, I builded mee houses, I planted mee Uineyards.
b.ECC.2.5	I made mee gardens &amp; orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinde of

b.ECC.2.7	I got me seruants and maydens, and had seruants borne in my house; also I had

b.ECC.2.9	So I was great, and increased more then all that were before mee in Ierusalem;
b.ECC.3.1	To euery thing there is a season, and a time to euery purpose vnder the heauen.
b.ECC.3.10	I haue seene the trauaile which God hath giuen to the sonnes of men, to be
b.ECC.3.11	He hath made euery thing beautifull in his time: also hee hath set the world
b.ECC.3.12	I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to reioyce, and to doe
b.ECC.3.13	And also that euery man should eate and drinke, and enioy the good of all his
b.ECC.3.14	I know that whatsoeuer God doeth, it shalbe for euer: nothing can be put to
b.ECC.3.15	That which hath beene, is now: and that which is to be, hath alreadie beene,
b.ECC.3.16	And moreouer, I sawe vnder the Sunne the place of iudgement, that wickednesse
b.ECC.3.17	I said in mine heart, God shall iudge the righteous and the wicked: for there
b.ECC.3.18	I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sonnes of men, that God might

b.ECC.3.2	A time to be borne, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck vp
b.ECC.3.20	All goe vnto one place, all are of the dust, and all turne to dust againe.
b.ECC.3.21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth vpward; and the spirit of the beast
b.ECC.3.22	Wherefore I perceiue that there is nothing better, then that a man should
b.ECC.3.3	A time to kill, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to
b.ECC.3.4	A time to weepe, and a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance.
b.ECC.3.5	A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together: a time to
b.ECC.3.6	A time to get, and a time to lose: a time to keepe, and a time to cast away.
b.ECC.3.7	A time to rent, and a time to sow: a time to keepe silence, and a time to
b.ECC.3.8	A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace.
b.ECC.3.9	What profite hath hee that worketh, in that wherein he laboureth?
b.ECC.4.1	So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done vnder the
b.ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift vp his fellow; but woe to him that is
b.ECC.4.11	Againe, if two lye together, then they haue heate; but howe can one be warme
b.ECC.4.12	And if one preuaile against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold
b.ECC.4.13	Better is a poore and a wise child, then an old and foolish king who will no

b.ECC.4.16	There is no end of all the people, euen of all that haue beene before them:
b.ECC.4.2	Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead, more then the liuing
b.ECC.4.3	Yea better is he then both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seene
b.ECC.4.4	Againe I considered all trauaile, and euery right worke, that for this a man
b.ECC.4.5	The foole foldeth his hands together, and eateth his owne flesh.
b.ECC.4.6	Better is an handfull with quietnesse, then both the hands full with trauell
b.ECC.4.7	Then I returned, and I saw vanitie vnder the Sunne.
b.ECC.4.8	There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither childe nor
b.ECC.4.9	Two are better then one; because they haue a good reward for their labour.
b.ECC.5.1	Kepe thy foote when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to heare,
b.ECC.5.10	Hee that loueth siluer shall not be satisfied with siluer; nor he that loueth
b.ECC.5.11	When goods increase, they are increased that eate them: and what good is
b.ECC.5.12	The sleepe of a labouring man is sweete, whether he eate little or much: but
b.ECC.5.13	There is a sore euill which I haue seene vnder the Sun, namely riches kept
b.ECC.5.14	But those riches perish by euill trauell; and he begetteth a sonne, and there
b.ECC.5.15	As he came forth of his mothers wombe, naked shall he returne to goe as he
b.ECC.5.16	And this also is a sore euill, that in all points as he came, so shall hee
b.ECC.5.17	All his dayes also hee eateth in darkenesse, and he hath much sorrowe, and
b.ECC.5.18	Behold that which I haue seene: It is good and comely for one to eate and to
b.ECC.5.19	Euery man also to whom God hath giuen riches and wealth, and hath giuen him
b.ECC.5.2	Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to vtter any
b.ECC.5.20	For he shall not much remember the dayes of his life: because God answereth

b.ECC.5.4	When thou vowest a vow vnto God, deferre not to pay it: for he hath no

b.ECC.6.1	There is an euill which I haue seen vnder the Sun, and it is common among men:
b.ECC.6.10	That which hath bene, is named already, and it is knowen that it is man:
b.ECC.6.11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanitie, what is man the better?
b.ECC.6.12	For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the dayes of his vaine
b.ECC.6.2	A man to whom God hath giuen riches, wealth and honour, so that he wanteth
b.ECC.6.3	If a man beget an hundred children, and liue many yeeres, so that the dayes of

b.ECC.6.5	Moreouer hee hath not seene the Sunne, nor knowen any thing: this hath more
b.ECC.6.6	Yea though he liue a thousand yeeres twice told, yet hath he seene no good:
b.ECC.6.7	All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
b.ECC.6.8	For what hath the wise more then the foole? what hath the poore, that knoweth
b.ECC.6.9	Better is the sight of the eyes, then the wandering of the desire: this is
b.ECC.7.1	A Good name is better then precious ointment: and the day of death, then the
b.ECC.7.10	Say not thou, What is the cause that the former dayes were better then these?
b.ECC.7.11	Wisedome is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profite to them that

b.ECC.7.15	All things haue I seene in the dayes of my vanitie: there is a iust man that
b.ECC.7.16	Be not righteous ouer much, neither make thy selfe ouer wise: why shouldest
b.ECC.7.17	Be not ouermuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die
b.ECC.7.18	It is good that thou shouldest take holde of this, yea also from this
b.ECC.7.19	Wisedome strengtheneth the wise, more then ten mightie men which are in the
b.ECC.7.2	It is better to goe to the house of mourning, then to goe to the house of
b.ECC.7.20	For there is not a iust man vpon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
b.ECC.7.21	Also take no heede vnto all words that are spoken; lest thou heare thy
b.ECC.7.22	For often times also thine owne heart knoweth, that thou thy selfe likewise
b.ECC.7.23	All this haue I prooued by wisedome: I said, I will be wise, but it was farre
b.ECC.7.24	That which is farre off, and exceeding deepe, who can finde it out?
b.ECC.7.25	I applyed mine heart to know, and to search, and to seeke out wisdome, and
b.ECC.7.26	And I finde more bitter then death, the woman whose heart is snares &amp;
b.ECC.7.27	Behold, this haue I found (saith the Preacher) counting one by one to finde
b.ECC.7.28	Which yet my soule seeketh, but I finde not: one man among a thousand haue I
b.ECC.7.29	Loe, this onely haue I found, that God hath made man vpright: but they haue
b.ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better then laughter: for by the sadnesse of the countenance the
b.ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning: but the heart of fooles is
b.ECC.7.5	It is better to heare the rebuke of the wise, then for a man to heare the song
b.ECC.7.6	For as the crackling of thornes vnder a pot, so is the laughter of the foole:
b.ECC.7.7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad: and a gift destroyeth the heart.
b.ECC.7.8	Better is the ende of a thing then the beginning thereof: and the patient in

b.ECC.8.11	Because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily; therefore
b.ECC.8.12	Though a sinner doe euill an hundred times, and his dayes be prolonged; yet
b.ECC.8.13	But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall hee prolong his dayes
b.ECC.8.14	There is a vanitie which is done vpon the earth, that there be iust men vnto
b.ECC.8.15	Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing vnder the Sunne,
b.ECC.8.16	When I applied mine heart to know wisedome, and to see the busines that is

b.ECC.9.12	For man also knoweth not his time, as the fishes that are taken in an euil
b.ECC.9.13	This wisedome haue I seene also vnder the Sunne, and it seemed great vnto me:
b.ECC.9.14	There was a little citie, and few men within it; and there came a great King
b.ECC.9.15	Now there was found in it a poore wise man, and hee by his wisedome deliuered
b.ECC.9.16	Then said I, Wisedome is better then strength: neuerthelesse, the poore mans
b.ECC.9.17	The words of wise men are heard in quiet, more then the cry of him that
b.ECC.9.18	Wisedome is better then weapons of warre: but one sinner destroyeth much
b.ECC.9.2	All things come alike to all: there is one euent to the righteous and to the
b.ECC.9.3	This is an euill among all things that are done vnder the Sunne, that there is
b.ECC.9.4	For to him that is ioyned to all the liuing, there is hope: for a liuing dogge
b.ECC.9.5	For the liuing know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing,
b.ECC.9.6	Also their loue, and their hatred, and their enuy is now perished; neither

b.EPH.1.17	That the God of our Lord Iesus Christ the Father of glorie, may giue vnto you
b.EPH.1.18	The eyes of your vnderstanding being inlightned: that yee may know what is
b.EPH.1.19	And what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power to vs-ward who beleeue,
b.EPH.1.2	Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus
b.EPH.1.20	Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at
b.EPH.1.21	Farre aboue all principalitie, and power, and might, and dominion, and euery

b.EPH.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath blessed vs
b.EPH.1.4	According as he hath chosen vs in him, before the foundation of the world,
b.EPH.1.5	Hauing predestinated vs vnto the adoption of children by Iesus Christ to
b.EPH.1.6	To the praise of the glorie of his grace, wherein he hath made vs accepted in
b.EPH.1.7	In whom wee haue redemption through his blood, the forgiuenesse of sinnes,
b.EPH.1.8	Wherein hee hath abounded toward vs in all wisedome and prudence:
b.EPH.1.9	Hauing made knowen vnto vs the mysterie of his will, according to his good
b.EPH.2.1	And you hath hee quickned who were dead in trespasses, and sinnes,
b.EPH.2.10	For wee are his workemanship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which
b.EPH.2.11	Wherefore remember that ye being in time passed Gentiles in the flesh, who

b.EST.2.10	Esther had not shewed her people, nor her kinred: for Mordecai had charged
b.EST.2.11	And Mordecai walked euery day before the court of the womens house, to know

b.EST.2.20	Esther had not yet shewed her kindred, nor her people, as Mordecai had

b.EST.2.9	And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindnesse of him, and hee
b.EST.3.1	After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman, the sonne of Amedatha the
b.EST.3.10	And the king tooke his ring from his hand, and gaue it vnto Haman the sonne
b.EST.3.11	And the king saide vnto Haman, The siluer is giuen to thee, the people also,
b.EST.3.12	Then were the kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first moneth,
b.EST.3.13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the kings prouinces, to destroy,
b.EST.3.14	The copie of the writing for a commandement to bee giuen in euery prouince,
b.EST.3.15	The postes went out, being hastened by the kings commandement, and the decree
b.EST.3.2	And all the kings seruants, that were in the kings gate, bowed, and reuerenced
b.EST.3.3	Then the kings seruants, which were in the kings gate, sayd vnto Mordecai, Why
b.EST.3.4	Now it came to passe, when they spake daily vnto him, and he hearkened not
b.EST.3.5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reuerence, then was
b.EST.3.6	And hee thought scorne to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had shewed him
b.EST.3.7	In the first moneth (that is, the moneth Nisan) in the twelfth yeere of king
b.EST.3.8	And Haman saide vnto king Ahasuerus: There is a certaine people scattered
b.EST.3.9	If it please the king, let it be written, that they may be destroyed: and I
b.EST.4.1	When Mordecai perceiued all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put
b.EST.4.10	Againe Esther spake vnto Hatach, and gaue him commaundement vnto Mordecai;
b.EST.4.11	All the Kings seruants, and the people of the kings prouinces do know, that
b.EST.4.12	And they tolde to Mordecai Esthers words.
b.EST.4.13	Then Mordecai commanded to answere Esther; Thinke not with thy selfe that
b.EST.4.14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there
b.EST.4.15	Then Esther bade them returne Mordecai this answere:
b.EST.4.16	Goe, gather together all the Iewes that are present in Shushan, and fast yee
b.EST.4.17	So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded
b.EST.4.2	And came euen before the kings gate: for none might enter into the kings gate
b.EST.4.3	And in euery prouince, whithersoeuer the kings commaundement, and his decree
b.EST.4.4	So Esthers maides and her chamberlaines came, and told it her: then was the
b.EST.4.5	Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the kings chamberlaines, whom he had

b.EST.4.8	Also he gaue him the copie of the writing of the decree, that was giuen at

b.EST.5.1	Now it came to passe on the third day, that Esther put on her royall apparell,
b.EST.5.10	Neuerthelesse Haman refrained himselfe, and when he came home, hee sent and
b.EST.5.11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his

b.EST.5.13	Yet all this auaileth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Iew sitting
b.EST.5.14	Then saide Zeresh his wife, and all his friends vnto him, Let a gallous be
b.EST.5.2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther the Queene standing in the court, that
b.EST.5.3	Then sayd the King vnto her, What wilt thou, Queene Esther? and what is thy
b.EST.5.4	And Esther answered, If it seeme good vnto the King, let the King and Haman
b.EST.5.5	Then the King sayd, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may doe as Esther hath
b.EST.5.6	And the king said vnto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition,
b.EST.5.7	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition, and my request is,
b.EST.5.8	If I haue found fauour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to
b.EST.5.9	Then went Haman foorth that day, ioyfull, and with a glad heart: but when
b.EST.6.1	On that night could not the King sleepe, and hee commaunded to bring the booke
b.EST.6.10	Then the king saide to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparell, and the
b.EST.6.11	Then tooke Haman the apparell, and the horse, &amp; arayed Mordecai, and
b.EST.6.12	And Mordecai came againe to the kings gate: but Haman hasted to his house,
b.EST.6.13	And Haman told Zeresh his wife, and all his friends, euery thing that had

b.EST.6.2	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana, and Teresh, two
b.EST.6.3	And the king said, What honour and dignitie hath bene done to Mordecai for
b.EST.6.4	And the king said, Who is in the court? (now Haman was come into the outward
b.EST.6.5	And the kings seruants said vnto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And
b.EST.6.6	So Haman came in, and the king said vnto him, What shall be done vnto the man
b.EST.6.7	And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,
b.EST.6.8	Let the royall apparell bee brought, which the King vseth to weare, and the
b.EST.6.9	And let this apparell and horse bee deliuered to the hand of one of the kings
b.EST.7.1	So the King and Haman came to banquet with Esther the Queene.
b.EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then
b.EST.7.2	And the king said againe vnto Esther, on the second day at the banquet of

b.EST.7.7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath, went into the
b.EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden, into the place of the banquet
b.EST.7.9	And Harbonah one of the chamberlaines, said before the king; Behold also the

b.EST.8.10	And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus name, and sealed it with the kings Ring,
b.EST.8.11	Wherein the King granted the Iewes, which were in euery citie, to gather

b.EST.8.3	And Esther spake yet againe before the king, and fell downe at his feet, and
b.EST.8.4	Then the king helde out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose, and
b.EST.8.5	And said, If it please the king, and if I haue found fauour in his sight, and

b.EXO.12.42	It is a night to be much obserued vnto the Lord, for bringing them out from

b.EXO.13.18	But God ledde the people about through the way of the wildernesse of the Red

b.EXO.13.21	And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the
b.EXO.13.22	He tooke not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by
b.EXO.13.3	And Moses said vnto the people, Remember this day, in which yee came out from
b.EXO.13.4	This day came yee out, in the moneth Abib.
b.EXO.13.5	And it shalbe when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites,
b.EXO.13.6	Seuen dayes thou shalt eate vnleauened bread, and in the seuenth day shall be

b.EXO.1.4	Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
b.EXO.14.1	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.EXO.14.10	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lift vp their eyes, and
b.EXO.14.11	And they said vnto Moses, Because there were no graues in Egypt, hast thou
b.EXO.14.12	Is not this the word that wee did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let vs alone,
b.EXO.14.13	And Moses saide vnto the people, Feare ye not, stand still, and see the
b.EXO.14.14	The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
b.EXO.14.15	And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Wherefore criest thou vnto me? Speake vnto the
b.EXO.14.16	But lift thou vp thy rodde, and stretch out thine hand ouer the Sea, and
b.EXO.14.17	And I, beholde, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall
b.EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I haue gotten me honour
b.EXO.14.19	And the Angel of God which went before the campe of Israel, remoued and went
b.EXO.14.2	Speake vnto the children of Israel, that they turne and encampe before Pi-hahiroth,
b.EXO.14.20	And it came betweene the campe of the Egyptians, and the campe of Israel, and
b.EXO.14.21	And Moses stretched out his hand ouer the Sea, and the Lord caused the Sea to
b.EXO.14.22	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the Sea vpon the dry
b.EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them, to the midst of the Sea,
b.EXO.14.24	And it came to passe, that in the morning watch the Lord looked vnto the
b.EXO.14.25	And tooke off their charet wheeles, that they draue them heauily: So that the
b.EXO.14.26	And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand ouer the Sea, that the
b.EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched foorth his hand ouer the sea, and the sea returned to his
b.EXO.14.28	And the waters returned, and couered the charets, and the horsemen, and all
b.EXO.14.29	But the children of Israel walked vpon drie land, in the midst of the sea,
b.EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are intangled in the
b.EXO.14.30	Thus the Lord saued Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians: and
b.EXO.14.31	And Israel saw that great worke which the Lord did vpon the Egyptians: &amp;
b.EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaohs heart, that he shall follow after them, and I will
b.EXO.14.5	And it was told the King of Egypt, that the people fled: And the heart of
b.EXO.14.6	And hee made ready his charet, and tooke his people with him.
b.EXO.14.7	And hee tooke sixe hundred chosen charets, and all the charets of Egypt, and
b.EXO.14.8	And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh King of Egypt, and he pursued after
b.EXO.14.9	But the Egyptians pursued after them (all the horses and charets of Pharaoh,
b.EXO.1.5	And all the soules that came out of the loynes of Iacob, were seuentie soules:
b.EXO.15.1	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song vnto the Lord, and spake,
b.EXO.15.10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea couered them, they sanke as lead in
b.EXO.15.11	Who is like vnto thee, O Lord, amongst the gods? who is like thee, glorious
b.EXO.15.12	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
b.EXO.15.13	Thou in thy mercie hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou
b.EXO.15.14	The people shall heare, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
b.EXO.15.15	Then the dukes of Edom shal be amased: the mighty men of Moab trembling shall
b.EXO.15.16	Feare and dread shall fall vpon them, by the greatnesse of thine arme they
b.EXO.15.17	Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountaine of thine
b.EXO.15.18	The Lord shal reigne for euer and euer.
b.EXO.15.19	For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his charets and with his horsemen into
b.EXO.15.2	The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my saluation: he is my God,
b.EXO.15.20	And Miriam the prophetesse the sister of Aaron, tooke a timbrell in her hand,
b.EXO.15.21	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
b.EXO.15.22	So Moses brought Israel from the red sea, and they went out into the
b.EXO.15.23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drinke of the waters of Marah,
b.EXO.15.24	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall wee drinke?
b.EXO.15.25	And he cried vnto the Lord: and the Lord shewed him a tree, which when hee
b.EXO.15.26	And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God,
b.EXO.15.27	And they came to Elim: where were twelue wels of water, and threescore and
b.EXO.15.3	The Lord is a man of warre: the Lord is his Name.
b.EXO.15.4	Pharaohs charets and his hoste hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captaines
b.EXO.15.5	The depths haue couered them: they sanke into the bottome as a stone.
b.EXO.15.6	Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power, thy right hand, O Lord,
b.EXO.15.7	And in the greatnesse of thine excellencie thou hast ouerthrowen them, that
b.EXO.15.8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together: the
b.EXO.15.9	The enemie said, I will pursue, I wil ouertake, I wil diuide the spoile: my
b.EXO.1.6	And Ioseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
b.EXO.16.1	And they tooke their iourney from Elim, and all the Congregation of the
b.EXO.16.10	And it came to passe as Aaron spake vnto the whole Congregation of the
b.EXO.16.11	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.EXO.16.12	I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: Speake vnto them,
b.EXO.16.13	And it came to passe, that at euen the Quailes came vp, and couered the campe:
b.EXO.16.14	And when the dewe that lay was gone vp, behold, vpon the face of the
b.EXO.16.15	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is
b.EXO.16.16	This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded: gather of it euery man
b.EXO.16.17	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some lesse.
b.EXO.16.18	And when they did mete it with an Omer, he that gathered much, had nothing
b.EXO.16.19	And Moses saide, Let no man leaue of it till the morning.
b.EXO.16.2	And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses
b.EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they hearkened not vnto Moses, but some of them left of it
b.EXO.16.21	And they gathered it euery morning, euery man according to his eating: and
b.EXO.16.22	And it came to passe that on the sixt day they gathered twice as much bread,
b.EXO.16.23	And he said vnto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow is
b.EXO.16.24	And they laid it vp till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stinke,
b.EXO.16.25	And Moses saide, Eate that to day, for to day is a Sabbath vnto the Lord: to
b.EXO.16.26	Sixe dayes ye shall gather it, but on the seuenth day which is the Sabbath,
b.EXO.16.27	And it came to passe, that there went out some of the people on the seuenth
b.EXO.16.28	And the Lord said vnto Moses, How long refuse yee to keepe my Commandements,
b.EXO.16.29	See, for that the Lord hath giuen you the Sabbath, therefore hee giueth you
b.EXO.16.3	And the children of Israel saide vnto them, Would to God wee had died by the
b.EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seuenth day.
b.EXO.16.31	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like
b.EXO.16.32	And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth: Fill an Omer of
b.EXO.16.33	And Moses sayd vnto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an Omer full of Manna therein,
b.EXO.16.34	As the Lord commaunded Moses, so Aaron layd it vp before the Testimonie, to
b.EXO.16.35	And the children of Israel did eat Manna fortie yeeres, vntill they came to a
b.EXO.16.36	Now an Omer is the tenth part of an Ephah.
b.EXO.16.4	Then said the Lord vnto Moses, Behold, I will raine bread from heauen for you:
b.EXO.16.5	And it shall come to passe, that on the sixt day, they shall prepare that
b.EXO.16.6	And Moses and Aaron said vnto all the children of Israel, At euen, then ye
b.EXO.16.7	And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord, for that he
b.EXO.16.8	And Moses said, This shalbe when the Lord shal giue you in the euening flesh
b.EXO.16.9	And Moses spake vnto Aaron, Say vnto all the Congregation of the children of
b.EXO.1.7	And the children of Israel were fruitfull, and increased aboundantly, and
b.EXO.17.1	And all the Congregation of the children of Israel iourneyed from the
b.EXO.17.10	So Ioshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses,
b.EXO.17.11	And it came to passe when Moses held vp his hand, that Israel preuailed: and
b.EXO.17.12	But Moses hands were heauie, and they tooke a stone, and put it vnder him,
b.EXO.17.13	And Ioshua discomfited Amalek, and his people, with the edge of the sword.
b.EXO.17.14	And the Lord said vnto Moses, Write this for a memoriall in a booke, and
b.EXO.17.15	And Moses built an Altar, and called the name of it IEHOUAH Nissi.
b.EXO.17.16	For he said, Because the Lord hath sworne that the Lord will haue warre with
b.EXO.17.2	Wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said, Giue vs water that wee may
b.EXO.17.3	And the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against
b.EXO.17.4	And Moses cried vnto the Lord, saying, What shall I doe vnto this people? They
b.EXO.17.5	And the Lord said vnto Moses, Goe on before the people, and take with thee of
b.EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before thee there, vpon the rocke in Horeb, and thou
b.EXO.17.7	And hee called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the
b.EXO.17.8	Then came Amalek, &amp; fought with Israel in Rephidim.
b.EXO.17.9	And Moses said vnto Ioshua, Choose vs out men, and goe out, fight with Amalek:
b.EXO.1.8	Now there arose vp a new King ouer Egypt, which knew not Ioseph.
b.EXO.18.1	When Iethro the Priest of Midian, Moses father in law, heard of all that God
b.EXO.18.10	And Iethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath deliuered you out of the hand
b.EXO.18.11	Now I know that the Lord is greater then all gods: for in the thing wherein
b.EXO.18.12	And Iethro, Moses father in law, tooke a burnt offering and sacrifices for
b.EXO.18.13	And it came to passe on the morrow, that Moses sate to iudge the people: and
b.EXO.18.14	And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What
b.EXO.18.15	And Moses said vnto his father in law, Because the people come vnto me to
b.EXO.18.16	When they haue a matter, they come vnto mee, and I iudge betweene one and
b.EXO.18.17	And Moses father in law saide vnto him, The thing that thou doest, is not
b.EXO.18.18	Thou wilt surely weare away, both thou, and this people that is with thee:
b.EXO.18.19	Hearken now vnto my voyce, I will giue thee counsell, and God shall be with
b.EXO.18.2	Then Iethro Moses father in law tooke Zipporah Moses wife, after he had sent
b.EXO.18.20	And thou shalt teach them ordinances and lawes, and shalt shew them the way
b.EXO.18.21	Moreouer thou shalt prouide out of all the people able men, such as feare
b.EXO.18.22	And let them iudge the people at all seasons: and it shall bee that euery
b.EXO.18.23	If thou shalt doe this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt bee
b.EXO.18.24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had
b.EXO.18.25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads ouer the
b.EXO.18.26	And they iudged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought vnto
b.EXO.18.27	And Moses let his father in law depart, and he went his way into his owne
b.EXO.18.3	And her two sonnes, of which the name of the one was Gershom: for he said, I
b.EXO.18.4	And the name of the other was Eliezer: for the God of my father, said he, was
b.EXO.18.5	And Iethro Moses father in law came with his sonnes and his wife vnto Moses
b.EXO.18.6	And he said vnto Moses, I thy father in law Iethro am come vnto thee, and thy
b.EXO.18.7	And Moses went out to meete his father in law, and did obeysance, and kissed
b.EXO.18.8	And Moses told his father in law, all that the Lord had done vnto Pharaoh, and
b.EXO.18.9	And Iethro reioyced for all the goodnesse which the Lord had doue to Israel:
b.EXO.1.9	And he said vnto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are
b.EXO.19.1	In the third moneth when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the
b.EXO.19.10	And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Goe vnto the people, and sanctifie them to day
b.EXO.19.11	And be ready against the thirde day: for the third day the Lord will come
b.EXO.19.12	And thou shalt set bounds vnto the people round about, saying, Take heed to
b.EXO.19.13	There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot thorow,
b.EXO.19.14	And Moses went downe from the mount vnto the people, and sanctified the
b.EXO.19.15	And hee said vnto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at
b.EXO.19.16	And it came to passe on the third day in the morning, that there were
b.EXO.19.17	And Moses brought foorth the people out of the campe to meete with God, and
b.EXO.19.18	And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended vpon it
b.EXO.19.19	And when the voyce of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed lowder and lowder,
b.EXO.19.2	For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai,
b.EXO.19.20	And the Lord came downe vpon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the
b.EXO.19.21	And the Lord said vnto Moses, Goe downe, charge the people, lest they breake
b.EXO.19.22	And let the Priestes also which come neere to the Lord, sanctifie themselues,
b.EXO.19.23	And Moses said vnto the Lord, The people cannot come vp to mount Sinai: for
b.EXO.19.24	And the Lord said vnto him, Away, get thee downe, and thou shalt come vp,
b.EXO.19.25	So Moses went downe vnto the people, and spake vnto them.
b.EXO.19.3	And Moses went vp vnto God: and the Lord called vnto him out of the mountaine,
b.EXO.19.4	Ye haue seene what I did vnto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on Eagles
b.EXO.19.5	Now therfore if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keepe my couenant, then ye
b.EXO.19.6	And ye shall be vnto me a kingdome of Priestes, and an holy nation. These are
b.EXO.19.7	And Moses came and called for the Elders of the people, and layd before their
b.EXO.19.8	And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken,
b.EXO.19.9	And the Lord said vnto Moses, Loe, I come vnto thee in a thicke cloud, that
b.EXO.20.1	And God spake all these words, saying,
b.EXO.20.10	But the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not
b.EXO.20.11	For in sixe dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, the sea, and all that in
b.EXO.20.12	Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy dayes may bee long vpon the land,
b.EXO.20.13	Thou shalt not kill.
b.EXO.20.14	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
b.EXO.20.15	Thou shalt not steale.
b.EXO.20.16	Thou shalt not beare false witnes against thy neighbour.
b.EXO.20.17	Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house, thou shalt not couet thy
b.EXO.20.18	And all the people saw the thundrings, and the lightnings, and the noise of
b.EXO.20.19	And they saide vnto Moses, Speake thou with vs, and wee will heare: But let
b.EXO.20.2	I am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out
b.EXO.20.20	And Moses said vnto the people, Feare not: for God is come to prooue you, and
b.EXO.20.21	And the people stood afarre off, and Moses drew neere vnto the thicke
b.EXO.20.22	And the Lord said vnto Moses, Thus thou shalt say vnto the children of
b.EXO.20.23	Ye shall not make with me gods of siluer, neither shall ye make vnto you gods
b.EXO.20.24	An Altar of earth thou shalt make vnto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy
b.EXO.20.25	And if thou wilt make mee an Altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewen
b.EXO.20.26	Neither shalt thou goe vp by steps vnto mine Altar, that thy nakednesse be
b.EXO.20.3	Thou shalt haue no other Gods before me.
b.EXO.20.4	Thou shalt not make vnto thee any grauen Image, or any likenesse of any thing
b.EXO.20.5	Thou shalt not bow downe thy selfe to them, nor serue them: For I the Lord thy
b.EXO.20.6	And shewing mercy vnto thousands of them that loue mee, and keepe my
b.EXO.20.7	Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vaine: for the Lord will
b.EXO.20.8	Remember the Sabbath day, to keepe it holy.
b.EXO.20.9	Sixe dayes shalt thou labour, and doe all thy worke:
b.EXO.2.1	And there went a man of the house of Leui, &amp; tooke to wife a daughter of
b.EXO.2.10	And the childe grew, and shee brought him vnto Pharaohs daughter, and he
b.EXO.2.11	And it came to passe in those dayes, when Moses was growen, that he went out
b.EXO.21.1	Now these are the Iudgements which thou shalt set before them.
b.EXO.21.10	If he take him another wife, her food, her rayment, and her duety of mariage
b.EXO.21.11	And if he doe not these three vnto her, then shall she goe out free without
b.EXO.21.12	He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shalbe surely put to death.
b.EXO.21.13	And if a man lye not in wait, but God deliuer him into his hand, then I will
b.EXO.21.14	But if a man come presumptuously vpon his neighbour to slay him with guile,
b.EXO.21.15	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall bee surely put to death.
b.EXO.21.16	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand,
b.EXO.21.17	And hee that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely bee put to death.
b.EXO.21.18	And if men striue together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his
b.EXO.21.19	If hee rise againe, and walke abroad vpon his staffe, then shall hee that
b.EXO.2.12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man,
b.EXO.21.2	If thou buy an Hebrew seruant, sixe yeeres he shall serue, and in the seuenth
b.EXO.21.20	And if a man smite his seruant, or his mayd, with a rod, and hee die vnder
b.EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, hee shall not be punished, for

b.EXO.7.25	And seuen dayes were fulfilled after that the Lord had smitten the riuer.
b.EXO.7.3	And I will harden Pharaohs heart, and multiplie my signes and my wonders in

b.EXO.8.13	And the Lord did according to the word of Moses: and the frogges died out of
b.EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together vpon heapes, and the land stanke.
b.EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardned his heart, and
b.EXO.8.16	And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite
b.EXO.8.17	And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the

b.EXO.8.3	And the riuer shall bring foorth frogges abundantly, which shall goe vp and
b.EXO.8.30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord:
b.EXO.8.31	And the Lord did according to the word of Moses: and he remooued the swarmes
b.EXO.8.32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would hee let the
b.EXO.8.4	And the frogges shall come vp both on thee, and vpon thy people, and vpon all

b.EXO.9.13	And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand
b.EXO.9.14	For I will at this time send all my plagues vpon thine heart, and vpon thy

b.EXO.9.24	So there was haile, and fire mingled with the haile, very grieuous, such as

b.EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they were not growen vp.
b.EXO.9.33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands vnto

b.EXO.9.9	And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall bee a boyle
b.EZE.10.1	Then I looked, and beholde, in the firmament that was aboue the head of the
b.EZE.10.10	And as for their appearances, they foure had one likenes as if a wheele had
b.EZE.10.11	When they went, they went vpon their foure sides; they turned not as they
b.EZE.10.12	And their whole body, and their backes, and their handes, and their wings,
b.EZE.10.13	As for the wheeles, it was cried vnto them in my hearing, O wheele.
b.EZE.10.14	And euery one had foure faces: the first face was the face of a Cherub, and
b.EZE.10.15	And the Cherubims were lifted vp, this is the liuing creature that I saw by
b.EZE.10.16	And when the Cherubims went, the wheeles went by them: and when the Cherubims
b.EZE.10.17	When they stood, these stood, and when they were lifted vp, these lift vp
b.EZE.10.18	Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house, and
b.EZE.10.19	And the Cherubims lift vp their wings, and mounted vp from the earth in my

b.EZE.10.20	This is the liuing creature that I saw vnder the God of Israel, by the riuer
b.EZE.10.21	Euery one had foure faces a piece, and euery one foure wings, and the
b.EZE.10.22	And the likenesse of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the riuer
b.EZE.10.3	Now the Cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in,
b.EZE.10.4	Then the glory of the Lord went vp from the Cherub, and stood ouer the
b.EZE.10.5	And the sound of the Cherubims wings was heard euen to the vtter court, as the
b.EZE.10.6	And it came to passe that when he had commanded the man clothed with linnen,
b.EZE.10.7	And one Cherub stretched forth his hand from betweene the Cherubims vnto the
b.EZE.10.8	And there appeared in the Cherubims, the forme of a mans hand vnder their

b.EZE.1.1	Now it came to passe in the thirtieth yeere, in the fourth moneth, in the fifth
b.EZE.1.10	As for the likenesse of their faces, they foure had the face of a man, and
b.EZE.1.11	Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched vpward, two wings of
b.EZE.11.1	Moreouer the Spirit lift me vp, and brought me vnto the East gate of the Lords
b.EZE.11.10	Yee shall fall by the sword, I will iudge you in the border of Israel, and ye
b.EZE.11.11	This citie shall not be your cauldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the
b.EZE.11.12	And ye shall know that I am the Lord: for yee haue not walked in my statutes,
b.EZE.11.13	And it came to passe, when I prophecied, that Pelatiah the sonne of Benaiah
b.EZE.11.14	Againe the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.11.15	Sonne of man, thy brethren, euen thy brethren, the men of thy kinred, and all
b.EZE.11.16	Therefore say, Thus sayth the Lord God; Although I haue cast them farre off
b.EZE.11.17	Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God; I will euen gather you from the
b.EZE.11.18	And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable
b.EZE.11.19	And I wil giue them one heart, and I wil put a new spirit within you: and I
b.EZE.1.12	And they went euery one straight forward: whither the spirit was to goe, they
b.EZE.11.2	Then said he vnto me; Sonne of man, these are the men that deuise mischiefe,
b.EZE.11.20	That they may walke in my statutes, and keepe mine ordinances, and doe them:
b.EZE.11.21	But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable
b.EZE.11.22	Then did the Cherubims lift vp their wings, and the wheeles besides them, and
b.EZE.11.23	And the glory of the Lord went vp from the middest of the citie, and stood
b.EZE.11.24	Afterwards the spirit tooke me vp, and brought me in vision by the spirit of
b.EZE.11.25	Then I spake vnto them of the captiuity, all the things that the Lord had
b.EZE.1.13	As for the likenesse of the liuing creatures, their appearance was like
b.EZE.11.3	Which say, It is not neere, let vs build houses: this citie is the caldron,
b.EZE.1.14	And the liuing creatures ranne, and returned as the appearance of a flash of
b.EZE.11.4	Therefore prophecie against them, prophecie, O sonne of man.
b.EZE.1.15	Now as I behelde the liuing creatures: behold one wheele vpon the earth by
b.EZE.11.5	And the Spirit of the Lord fell vpon me, and said vnto me, Speake, thus saith
b.EZE.1.16	The appearance of the wheeles, and their worke was like vnto the colour of a
b.EZE.11.6	Ye haue multiplyed your slaine in this citie, and yee haue filled the streetes
b.EZE.1.17	When they went, they went vpon their foure sides: and they returned not when
b.EZE.11.7	Therefore thus sayth the Lord God; Your slaine whom ye haue laid in the
b.EZE.1.18	As for their rings, they were so high, that they were dreadful, and their
b.EZE.11.8	Ye haue feared the sword, and I will bring a sword vpon you, saith the Lord
b.EZE.1.19	And when the liuing creatures went, the wheeles went by them: and when the
b.EZE.11.9	And I will bring you out of the middest thereof, and deliuer you into the
b.EZE.1.2	In the fifth day of the moneth, (which was the fifth yeere of king Iehoiakins
b.EZE.1.20	Whithersoeuer the spirit was to goe, they went, thither was their spirit to
b.EZE.1.21	When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood; and when
b.EZE.12.1	The word of the Lord also came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.12.10	Say thou vnto them; Thus saith the Lord God; This burden concerneth the
b.EZE.12.11	Say, I am your signe: like as I haue done, so shall it be done vnto them:
b.EZE.12.12	And the Prince that is among them, shall beare vpon his shoulder in the
b.EZE.12.13	My net also will I spread vpon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I
b.EZE.12.14	And I will scatter toward euery winde all that are about him to helpe him,
b.EZE.12.15	And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shal scatter them among the
b.EZE.12.16	But I will leaue a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from
b.EZE.12.17	Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came to me, saying;
b.EZE.12.18	Sonne of man, eate thy bread with quaking, and drinke thy water with
b.EZE.12.19	And say vnto the people of the land; Thus sayth the Lord God, of the
b.EZE.1.22	And the likenesse of the firmament vpon the heads of the liuing creature was
b.EZE.12.2	Sonne of man, thou dwellest in the middest of a rebellious house, which haue
b.EZE.12.20	And the cities that are inhabited, shall be laid waste, and the land shall be
b.EZE.12.21	And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.12.22	Sonne of man, what is that prouerbe, that ye haue in the land of Israel,
b.EZE.12.23	Tell them therefore, Thus sayth the Lord God; I will make this prouerbe to
b.EZE.12.24	For there shall bee no more any vaine vision, nor flattering diuination,
b.EZE.12.25	For I am the Lord: I will speake, &amp; the word that I shall speake, shall
b.EZE.12.26	Againe the word of the Lord came to me, saying;
b.EZE.12.27	Sonne of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say; The vision that he
b.EZE.12.28	Therefore say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, There shal none of my words
b.EZE.1.23	And vnder the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other,
b.EZE.12.3	Therefore thou sonne of man, prepare thee stuffe for remoouing, and remooue by
b.EZE.1.24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great
b.EZE.12.4	Then shalt thou bring foorth thy stuffe by day in their sight, as stuffe for
b.EZE.1.25	And there was a voice from the firmament, that was ouer their heads, when
b.EZE.12.5	Digge thou through the wall in their sight, and cary out thereby.
b.EZE.1.26	And aboue the firmament that was ouer their heads, was the likenesse of a
b.EZE.12.6	In their sight shalt thou beare it vpon thy shoulders, and cary it foorth in
b.EZE.1.27	And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about
b.EZE.12.7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuffe by day, as stuffe
b.EZE.1.28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloude in the day of raine, so
b.EZE.12.8	And in the morning came the word of the Lord vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.12.9	Sonne of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, sayd vnto
b.EZE.1.3	The word of the Lord came expresly vnto Ezekiel the Priest, the sonne of Buzi,
b.EZE.13.1	And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee, saying;
b.EZE.13.10	Because, euen because they haue seduced my people, saying; Peace, and there
b.EZE.13.11	Say vnto them which dawbe it with vntempered morter, that it shall fall:
b.EZE.13.12	Loe, when the wall is fallen, shall it not bee sayde vnto you; Where is the
b.EZE.13.13	Therefore thus sayth the Lord God; I will euen rent it with a stormie wind in
b.EZE.13.14	So wil I breake downe the wall that ye haue dawbed with vntempered morter,
b.EZE.13.15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath vpon the wall, and vpon them that haue dawbed
b.EZE.13.16	To wit, the Prophets of Israel which prophecie concerning Ierusalem, and
b.EZE.13.17	Likewise thou sonne of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people;
b.EZE.13.18	And say, Thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the women that sow pillowes to all
b.EZE.13.19	And will yee pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley, and for
b.EZE.13.2	Sonne of man, prophecie against the Prophets of Israel that prophecie, and say
b.EZE.13.20	Wherefore thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I am against your pillowes,
b.EZE.13.21	Your kerchiefes also will I teare, and deliuer my people out of your hand,
b.EZE.13.22	Because with lyes yee haue made the heart of the righteous sad whom I haue
b.EZE.13.23	Therefore yee shall see no more vanitie, nor diuine diuinations, for I will
b.EZE.13.3	Thus saith the Lord God; Woe vnto the foolish prophets, that follow their owne
b.EZE.13.4	O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
b.EZE.13.5	Yee haue not gone vp into the gaps, neither made vp the hedge for the house of
b.EZE.13.6	They haue seene vanity, and lying diuination, saying; The Lord saith, and the
b.EZE.13.7	Haue ye not seene a vaine vision, and haue ye not spoken a lying diuination,
b.EZE.13.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye haue spoken vanity and seene
b.EZE.13.9	And mine hand shall be vpon the Prophets that see vanitie, and that diuine
b.EZE.1.4	And I looked, and behold, a whirlewinde came out of the North, a great cloude,
b.EZE.14.1	Then came certaine of the Elders of Israel vnto me, and sate before me.
b.EZE.14.10	And they shall beare the punishment of their iniquitie: the punishment of the
b.EZE.14.11	That the house of Israel may goe no more astray from me, neither be polluted
b.EZE.14.12	The word of the Lord came againe to me, saying,
b.EZE.14.13	Sonne of man, when the land sinneth against mee by trespassing grieuously,
b.EZE.14.14	Though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Iob were in it, they should deliuer
b.EZE.14.15	If I cause noisome beastes to passe through the land, and they spoile it, so
b.EZE.14.16	Though these three men were in it, as I liue, saith the Lord God, they shall
b.EZE.14.17	Or if I bring a sword vpon that land, and say, Sword, goe through the lande,
b.EZE.14.18	Though these three men were in it, as I liue, saith the Lord God, they shall
b.EZE.14.19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and powre out my fury vpon it in
b.EZE.14.2	And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.14.20	Though Noah, Daniel and Iob were in it, as I liue, saith the Lord God, they
b.EZE.14.21	For thus saith the Lord God, How much more when I send my foure sore
b.EZE.14.22	Yet behold, therein shalbe left a remnant that shalbe brought foorth, both
b.EZE.14.23	And they shall comfort you when yee see their wayes and their doings: and ye
b.EZE.14.3	Sonne of man, these men haue set vp their idoles in their heart, and put the
b.EZE.14.4	Therefore speake vnto them, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Euery
b.EZE.14.5	That I may take the house of Israel in their owne heart, because they are all
b.EZE.14.6	Therefore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Repent, and
b.EZE.14.7	For euery one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that soiourneth in
b.EZE.14.8	And I wil set my face against that man, and will make him a signe and a
b.EZE.14.9	And if the prophet bee deceiued when hee hath spoken a thing, I the Lord haue
b.EZE.1.5	Also out of the midst thereof came the likenesse of foure liuing creatures,
b.EZE.15.1	And the word of ye Lord came vnto me, saying.
b.EZE.15.2	Sonne of man, What is the Uine tree more then any tree, or then a branch which
b.EZE.15.3	Shall wood bee taken thereof to doe any worke? or, will men take a pin of it,
b.EZE.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fewell: the fire deuoureth both the ends
b.EZE.15.5	Behold, when it was whole it was meete for no worke: how much lesse shall it
b.EZE.15.6	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; As the Uine tree among the trees of the
b.EZE.15.7	And I will set my face against them, they shall goe out from one fire, and
b.EZE.15.8	And I will make the land desolate, because they haue committed a trespasse,
b.EZE.1.6	And euery one had foure faces, and euery one had foure wings.
b.EZE.16.1	Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.16.10	I clothed thee also with broidred worke, &amp; shod thee with badgers skin,
b.EZE.16.11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets vpon thine hands, and
b.EZE.16.12	And I put a iewell on thy forehead, and eare-rings in thine eares, and a
b.EZE.16.13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and siluer, and thy raiment was of fine linen
b.EZE.16.14	And thy renowme went foorth among the heathen for thy beautie: for it was
b.EZE.16.15	But thou diddest trust in thine owne beauty, and playedst the harlot, because
b.EZE.16.16	And of thy garments thou diddest take, and deckedst thy high places with
b.EZE.16.17	Thou hast also taken thy faire iewels of my gold and of my siluer, which I
b.EZE.16.18	And tookest thy broidered garments and coueredst them: and thou hast set mine
b.EZE.16.19	My meate also which I gaue thee, fine flowre, and oyle, and honie wherewith I
b.EZE.16.2	Son of man, cause Ierusalem to know her abominations,
b.EZE.16.20	Moreouer thou hast taken thy sonnes and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne
b.EZE.16.21	That thou hast slaine my children, and deliuered them to cause them to passe
b.EZE.16.22	And in all thine abominations and thy whooredomes, thou hast not remembred
b.EZE.16.23	And it came to passe after all thy wickednesse (woe, woe vnto thee, saith the
b.EZE.16.24	That thou hast also built vnto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an
b.EZE.16.25	Thou hast built thy high place at euery head of the way, and hast made thy
b.EZE.16.26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours great
b.EZE.16.27	Behold therefore, I haue stretched out my hand ouer thee, and haue diminished
b.EZE.16.28	Thou hast played the whoore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast
b.EZE.16.29	Thou hast moreouer multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan vnto
b.EZE.16.3	And say, Thus saith the Lord God vnto Ierusalem; Thy birth and thy natiuitie
b.EZE.16.30	How weake is thine heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest all these
b.EZE.16.31	In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of euery way, and
b.EZE.16.32	But as a wife that committeth adulterie, which taketh strangers in steede of
b.EZE.16.33	They giue gifts to all whores, but thou giuest thy gifts to all thy louers,
b.EZE.16.34	And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredomes, whereas none
b.EZE.16.35	Wherefore, O harlot, heare the word of the Lord.
b.EZE.16.36	Thus saith the Lord God; Because thy filthinesse was powred out, and thy
b.EZE.16.37	Behold therefore, I will gather all thy louers, with whom thou hast taken
b.EZE.16.38	And I will iudge thee, as women that breake wedlocke and shead blood are
b.EZE.16.39	And I will also giue thee into their hand, and they shal throw downe thine
b.EZE.16.4	And as for thy natiuity in the day thou wast borne, thy nauell was not cut,
b.EZE.16.40	They shall also bring vp a companie against thee, and they shall stone thee
b.EZE.16.41	And they shall burne thine houses with fire, and execute iudgements vpon thee
b.EZE.16.42	So will I make my fury towards thee to rest, and my iealousie shall depart
b.EZE.16.43	Because thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, but hast fretted mee
b.EZE.16.44	Behold, euery one that vseth prouerbs, shall vse this prouerbe against thee,
b.EZE.16.45	Thou art thy mothers daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children, and
b.EZE.16.46	And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters, that dwell at thy
b.EZE.16.47	Yet hast thou not walked after their wayes, nor done after their
b.EZE.16.48	As I liue, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her
b.EZE.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquitie of thy sister Sodom; Pride, fulnesse of bread,
b.EZE.16.5	None eye pitied thee to doe any of these vnto thee, to haue compassion vpon
b.EZE.16.50	And they were hautie, and committed abomination before me: therefore I tooke
b.EZE.16.51	Neither hath Samaria committed halfe of thy sinnes, but thou hast multiplied
b.EZE.16.52	Thou also which hast iudged thy sisters, beare thine owne shame for thy
b.EZE.16.53	When I shall bring againe their captiuitie, the captiuitie of Sodom and her
b.EZE.16.54	That thou mayest beare thine owne shame, and mayest be confounded in all that
b.EZE.16.55	When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters shal returne to their former
b.EZE.16.56	For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride;
b.EZE.16.57	Before thy wickednesse was discouered, as at the time of thy reproch of the
b.EZE.16.58	Thou hast borne thy lewdnesse, and thine abominations, saith the Lord.
b.EZE.16.59	For thus saith the Lord God; I will euen deale with thee as thou hast done,
b.EZE.16.6	And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine owne blood, I said
b.EZE.16.60	Neuerthelesse I will remember my couenant with thee in the dayes of thy
b.EZE.16.61	Then thou shalt remember thy wayes and be ashamed, when thou shalt receiue
b.EZE.16.62	And I will establish my couenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the
b.EZE.16.63	That thou mayest remember, and bee confounded, and neuer open thy mouth any
b.EZE.16.7	I haue caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast
b.EZE.16.8	Now when I passed by thee, and looked vpon thee, behold, thy time was the time
b.EZE.16.9	Then washed I thee with water: yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from
b.EZE.1.7	And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the
b.EZE.17.1	And the word of the Lord came vnto mee, saying,
b.EZE.17.10	Yea behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not vtterly wither,
b.EZE.17.11	Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.17.12	Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things meane? tell
b.EZE.17.13	And hath taken of the kings seed, and made a couenant with him, and hath
b.EZE.17.14	That the kingdome might bee base, that it might not lift it selfe vp, but
b.EZE.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadours into Egypt, that they
b.EZE.17.16	As I liue, saith the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth
b.EZE.17.17	Neither shall Pharaoh with his mightie armie and great companie make for him
b.EZE.17.18	Seeing hee despised the oath by breaking the couenant (when loe, he had giuen
b.EZE.17.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, As I liue, surely mine oath that he hath
b.EZE.17.2	Sonne of man, put foorth a riddle, and speake a parable vnto the house of
b.EZE.17.20	And I will spread my net vpon him, &amp; he shalbe taken in my snare, and I
b.EZE.17.21	And all his fugitiues, with all his bands, shall fall by the sword, and they
b.EZE.17.22	Thus saith the Lord God, I wil also take of the highest branch of the high
b.EZE.17.23	In the mountaine of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring
b.EZE.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord haue brought downe
b.EZE.17.3	And say, Thus saith the Lord God, A great eagle with great wings, long wing'd,
b.EZE.17.4	Hee cropt off the top of his yong twigs, and caried it into a land of
b.EZE.17.5	Hee tooke also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitfull field,
b.EZE.17.6	And it grew, and became a spreading Uine of low stature, whose branches turned
b.EZE.17.7	There was also an other great eagle, with great wings and many feathers, and
b.EZE.17.8	It was planted in a good soile by great waters, that it might bring forth
b.EZE.17.9	Say thou, Thus saith the Lord God; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull vp the
b.EZE.1.8	And they had the handes of a man vnder their wings on their foure sides, and
b.EZE.18.1	And the word of ye Lord came vnto me againe, saying;
b.EZE.18.10	If hee beget a sonne that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doth the
b.EZE.18.11	And that doeth not any of those duties, bnt euen hath eaten vpon the
b.EZE.18.12	Hath oppressed the poore and needie, hath spoiled by violence, hath not
b.EZE.18.13	Hath giuen foorth vpon vsurie, and hath taken encrease: shall he then liue?
b.EZE.18.14	Now loe, if hee beget a sonne that seeth all his fathers sinnes which he hath
b.EZE.18.15	That hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the
b.EZE.18.16	Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath
b.EZE.18.17	That hath taken off his hand from the poore, that hath not receiued vsurie
b.EZE.18.18	As for his father, because hee cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by
b.EZE.18.19	Yet say yee, Why? doeth not the sonne beare the iniquitie of the father? when
b.EZE.18.2	What meane ye that yee vse this prouerbe concerning the land of Israel,
b.EZE.18.20	The soule that sinneth, it shal die: the sonne shall not beare the iniquitie
b.EZE.18.21	But if the wicked will turne from all his sinnes that he hath committed and
b.EZE.18.22	All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned
b.EZE.18.23	Haue I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord God ?
b.EZE.18.24	But when the righteous turneth away fro his righteousnes, &amp; committeth
b.EZE.18.25	Yet yee say; The way of the Lord is not equall. Heare now, O house of Israel;
b.EZE.18.26	When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnesse, &amp; committeth
b.EZE.18.27	Againe, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickednesse that he hath
b.EZE.18.28	Because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he
b.EZE.18.29	Yet saith the house of Israel; The way of the Lord is not equall. O house of
b.EZE.18.3	As I liue, saith the Lord God, yee shall not haue occasion any more to vse
b.EZE.18.30	Therefore I will iudge you, O house of Israel, euery one according to his
b.EZE.18.31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherby yee haue transgressed, and
b.EZE.18.32	For I haue no pleasure in ye death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God:
b.EZE.18.4	Behold, all soules are mine, as the soule of the father, so also the soule of
b.EZE.18.5	But if a man be iust, and do that which is lawfull and right:
b.EZE.18.6	And hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the
b.EZE.18.7	And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtourhis pledge, hath
b.EZE.18.8	He that hath not giuen foorth vpon vsurie, neither hath taken any increase,
b.EZE.18.9	Hath walked in my Statutes, and hath kept my Iudgements to deale truely; hee
b.EZE.1.9	Their wings were ioyned one to another, they turned not when they went: they
b.EZE.19.1	Moreouer, take thou vp a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
b.EZE.19.10	Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters, she was
b.EZE.19.11	And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that beare rule, and her
b.EZE.19.12	But she was plucked vp in fury: she was cast downe to the ground, and the
b.EZE.19.13	And now she is planted in the wildernesse, in a dry and thirsty ground.
b.EZE.19.14	And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath deuoured her fruite,
b.EZE.19.2	And say, What is thy mother? a lyonesse: shee lay downe among lions, she
b.EZE.19.3	And shee brought vp one of her whelps: it became a yong lion, &amp; it learned
b.EZE.19.4	The nations also heard of him, hee was taken in their pit, and they brought
b.EZE.19.5	Now when she saw that shee had waited, and her hope was lost, then she tooke
b.EZE.19.6	And he went vp and downe among the lions, he became a yong lion, and learned
b.EZE.19.7	And he knew there desolate palaces, and he laied waste their cities, and the
b.EZE.19.8	Then the nations set against him on euery side from the prouinces, and spread
b.EZE.19.9	And they put him in ward in chaines, and brought him to the king of Babylon,
b.EZE.20.1	And it came to passe in the seuenth yeere, in the fift moneth, the tenth day
b.EZE.20.10	Wherefore I caused them to goe foorth out of the land of Egypt, and brought
b.EZE.20.11	And I gaue them my statutes, and shewed them my iudgements, which if a man
b.EZE.20.12	Moreouer also, I gaue them my Sabbaths, to be a signe betweene mee and them,
b.EZE.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernesse: they walked
b.EZE.20.14	But I wrought for my names sake, that it should not bee polluted before the
b.EZE.20.15	Yet also I lifted vp my hand vnto them in the wildernesse, that I would not
b.EZE.20.16	Because they despised my iudgements, and walked not in my statutes, but
b.EZE.20.17	Neuerthelesse, mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make
b.EZE.20.18	But I said vnto their children in the wildernesse; Walke ye not in the
b.EZE.20.19	I am the Lord your God: walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements and doe
b.EZE.20.2	Then came the word of the Lord vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.20.20	And hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall be a signe betweene mee and you, that
b.EZE.20.21	Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my
b.EZE.20.22	Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names sake, that it
b.EZE.20.23	I lifted vp mine hand vnto them also in the wildernesse, that I would scatter
b.EZE.20.24	Because they had not executed my iudgements, but had despised my Statutes,
b.EZE.20.25	Wherefore I gaue them also statutes that were not good, and iudgements
b.EZE.20.26	And I polluted them in their owne gifts, in that they caused to passe through
b.EZE.20.27	Therefore sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, and say vnto them,
b.EZE.20.28	For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine
b.EZE.20.29	Then I said vnto them, What is the high place whereunto ye goe? and the name
b.EZE.20.3	Sonne of man, speake vnto the elders of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith
b.EZE.20.30	Wherefore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye
b.EZE.20.31	For when yee offer your gifts, when yee make your sonnes to passe through the
b.EZE.20.32	And that which cometh into your minde, shall not be at all, that ye say, We
b.EZE.20.33	As I liue, sayeth the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand, and with a
b.EZE.20.34	And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the
b.EZE.20.35	And I wil bring you into the wildernes of the people, and there will I plead
b.EZE.20.36	Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wildernes of the land of Egypt, so
b.EZE.20.37	And I will cause you to passe vnder the rod, and I will bring you into the
b.EZE.20.38	And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgresse
b.EZE.20.39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God, Goe yee, serue ye
b.EZE.20.4	Wilt thou iudge them, sonne of man, wilt thou iudge them? cause them to know
b.EZE.20.40	For in mine holy mountaine, in the mountaine of the height of Israel, saith
b.EZE.20.41	I will accept you with your sweet sauour, when I bring you out from the
b.EZE.20.42	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of
b.EZE.20.43	And there shall yee remember your wayes, &amp; all your doings, wherein ye
b.EZE.20.44	And ye shal know that I am the Lord, when I haue wrought with you for my
b.EZE.20.45	Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.20.46	Sonne of man, set thy face toward the South, and drop thy word toward the
b.EZE.20.47	And say to the forest of ye South, Heare the word of the Lord: Thus saith the
b.EZE.20.48	And all flesh shall see that I the Lord haue kindled it: it shall not be
b.EZE.20.49	Then said I, Ah Lord God, they say of me, Doeth he not speake parables?
b.EZE.20.5	And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when I chose Israel,
b.EZE.20.6	In the day that I lifted vp mine hand vnto them to bring them foorth of the
b.EZE.20.7	Then said I vnto them, Cast ye away euery man the abominations of his eyes,
b.EZE.20.8	But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken vnto mee: they did not
b.EZE.20.9	But I wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the
b.EZE.2.1	And he said vnto me, Son of man, stand vpon thy feete, and I will speake vnto
b.EZE.2.10	And he spread it before me, and it was written within and without, and there
b.EZE.21.1	And the word of ye Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.21.10	It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is fourbished, that it may
b.EZE.21.11	And he hath giuen it to be fourbished, that it may be handled: this sword is
b.EZE.21.12	Cry and howle, sonne of man, for it shalbe vpon my people, it shalbe vpon all
b.EZE.21.13	Because it is a tryall, and what if the sword contemne euen the rodde? it
b.EZE.21.14	Thou therefore sonne of man, prophecie and smite thine hands together, and
b.EZE.21.15	I haue set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart
b.EZE.21.16	Goe thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left,
b.EZE.21.17	I will also smite mine hands together, and I wil cause my furie to rest: I
b.EZE.21.18	The word of the Lord came vnto me againe, saying,
b.EZE.21.19	Also thou sonne of man, appoint thee two wayes, that the sword of the king of
b.EZE.21.2	Sonne of man, set thy face toward Ierusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy
b.EZE.21.20	Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to
b.EZE.21.21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the
b.EZE.21.22	At his right hand was the diuination for Ierusalem to appoint captaines, to
b.EZE.21.23	And it shall be vnto them as a false diuination in their sight, to them that
b.EZE.21.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because yee haue made your iniquitie to be
b.EZE.21.25	And thou prophane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquitie
b.EZE.21.26	Thus saith the Lord God, Remoue the diademe, and take off the crowne: this
b.EZE.21.27	I will ouerturne, ouerturne, ouerturne it, and it shall be no more, vntill he
b.EZE.21.28	And thou sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lord God concerning
b.EZE.21.29	Whiles they see vanitie vnto thee, whiles they diuine a lie vnto thee, to
b.EZE.21.3	And say to ye land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I am against thee,
b.EZE.21.30	Shall I cause it to returne into his sheath? I will iudge thee in the place
b.EZE.21.31	And I will powre out mine indignation vpon thee, I will blow against thee in
b.EZE.21.32	Thou shalt be for fuell to the fire: thy blood shall be in the middest of the
b.EZE.21.4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked,
b.EZE.21.5	That all flesh may know, that I the Lord haue drawen foorth my sword out of
b.EZE.21.6	Sigh therefore thou sonne of man with the breaking of thy loynes, and with
b.EZE.21.7	And it shall be, when they say vnto thee; Wherefore sighest thou? that thou
b.EZE.21.8	Againe, the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.21.9	Sonne of man, prophecie and say, Thus sayth the Lord, Say, A sword, a sword is
b.EZE.2.2	And the spirit entred into me, when hee spake vnto me, and set me vpon my
b.EZE.22.1	Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.22.10	In thee haue they discouered their fathers nakednesse: in thee haue they
b.EZE.22.11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife, and an other
b.EZE.22.12	In thee haue they taken gifts to shead blood: thou hast taken vsury and
b.EZE.22.13	Behold therefore, I haue smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gaine which thou
b.EZE.22.14	Can thine heart indure, or can thine hands be strong in the dayes that I
b.EZE.22.15	And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countreys,
b.EZE.22.16	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thy selfe in the sight of the
b.EZE.22.17	And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.22.18	Sonne of man, the house of Israel is to me become drosse: all they are brasse,
b.EZE.22.19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because ye are all become drosse, behold
b.EZE.22.2	Now thou sonne of man, wilt thou iudge, wilt thou iudge the bloodie citie? Yea
b.EZE.22.20	As they gather siluer, and brasse, and yron, and lead, and tinne into the
b.EZE.22.21	Yea, I will gather you, and blow vpon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye
b.EZE.22.22	As siluer is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the
b.EZE.22.23	And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.22.24	Son of man, say vnto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained
b.EZE.22.25	There is a conspiracie of her prophets in the middest thereof like a roaring
b.EZE.22.26	Her priests haue violated my law, and haue prophaned mine holy things: they
b.EZE.22.27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolues rauening the praye, to shed
b.EZE.22.28	And her prophets haue dawbed them with vntempered morter, seeing vanity, and
b.EZE.22.29	The people of the land haue vsed oppression, and exercised robbery, and haue
b.EZE.22.3	Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord God; The citie sheadeth blood in the
b.EZE.22.30	And I sought for a man among them, that should make vp the hedge, and stand
b.EZE.22.31	Therefore haue I powred out mine indignation vpon them, I haue consumed them
b.EZE.22.4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and hast defiled thy
b.EZE.22.5	Those that be neere, and those that be farre from thee, shall mocke thee which
b.EZE.22.6	Behold the princes of Israel, euerie one were in thee to their power to shead
b.EZE.22.7	In thee haue they set light by father and mother: in the middest of thee haue
b.EZE.22.8	Thou hast despised mine holy things, &amp; hast prophaned my sabbaths:
b.EZE.22.9	In thee are men that carie tales to shead blood: and in thee they eate vpon
b.EZE.2.3	And hee said vnto me, Sonne of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to
b.EZE.23.1	The word of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.23.10	These discouered her nakednes, they tooke her sonnes and her daughters, and
b.EZE.23.11	And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate
b.EZE.23.12	She doted vpon the Assyrians her neighbours, captaines and rulers clothed
b.EZE.23.13	Then I saw that she was defiled, that they tooke both one way;
b.EZE.23.14	And that she increased her whoredomes: for when shee saw men pourtrayed vpon
b.EZE.23.15	Girded with girdles vpon their loynes, exceeding in dyed attire vpon their
b.EZE.23.16	And assoone as shee saw them with her eyes, she doted vpon them, and sent
b.EZE.23.17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue, and they defiled her
b.EZE.23.18	So shee discouered her whoredomes, and discouered her nakednesse; then my
b.EZE.23.19	Yet shee multiplied her whoredomes, in calling to remembrance the dayes of
b.EZE.23.2	Sonne of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
b.EZE.23.20	For she doted vpon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and
b.EZE.23.21	Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdnesse of thy youth, in bruising thy
b.EZE.23.22	Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will raise vp thy
b.EZE.23.23	The Babylonians, and all the Caldeans, Pekod, and Shoah, and Koa, all the the
b.EZE.23.24	And they shall come against thee with charets, wagons and wheeles, and with
b.EZE.23.25	And I will set my ielousie against thee, and they shall deale furiously with
b.EZE.23.26	They shall also strippe thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy faire
b.EZE.23.27	Thus will I make thy lewdnesse to cease from thee, and thy whoredome brought
b.EZE.23.28	For thus saith the Lord God; Beholde, I will deliuer thee into the hand of
b.EZE.23.29	And they shall deale with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour,
b.EZE.23.3	And they committed whordomes in Egypt, they committed whordomes in their
b.EZE.23.30	I wil doe these things vnto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the
b.EZE.23.31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, therefore will I giue her cup into
b.EZE.23.32	Thus sayth the Lord God, Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cuppe deepe and
b.EZE.23.33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkennesse and sorrow, with the cup of
b.EZE.23.34	Thou shalt euen drinke it and sucke it out, and thou shalt breake the sheards
b.EZE.23.35	Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast
b.EZE.23.36	The Lord said moreouer vnto mee, Sonne of man, wilt thou iudge Aholah and
b.EZE.23.37	That they haue committed adulterie, and blood is in their handes, and with
b.EZE.23.38	Moreouer this they haue done vnto me: they haue defiled my Sanctuarie in the
b.EZE.23.39	For when they had slaine their children to their idoles, then they came the
b.EZE.23.4	And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they
b.EZE.23.40	And furthermore that yee haue sent for men to come from farre, vnto whom a
b.EZE.23.41	And satest vpon a stately bedde, and a table prepared before it, whereupon
b.EZE.23.42	And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her, and with the men of
b.EZE.23.43	Then said I vnto her that was olde in adulteries; Will they now commit
b.EZE.23.44	Yet they went in vnto her, as they goe in vnto a woman that playeth the
b.EZE.23.45	And the righteous men, they shall iudge them after the manner of
b.EZE.23.46	For thus sayth the Lord God, I will bring vp a company vpon them, and will
b.EZE.23.47	And the companie shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their
b.EZE.23.48	Thus will I cause lewdnesse to cease out of the land, that all women may be
b.EZE.23.49	And they shall recompense your lewdnesse vpon you, and ye shall beare the
b.EZE.23.5	And Aholah played the harlot, when she was mine, &amp; she doted on her louers,
b.EZE.23.6	Which were clothed with blew, captaines and rulers, all of them desireable
b.EZE.23.7	Thus she committed her whordomes with them, with all them that were the chosen
b.EZE.23.8	Neither left she her whoredomes brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay
b.EZE.23.9	Wherefore I haue deliuered her into the hand of her louers, into the hand of
b.EZE.2.4	For they are impudent children and stiffe hearted: I doe send thee vnto them,
b.EZE.24.1	Againe in the ninth yeere, in the tenth moneth, in the tenth day of the moneth,
b.EZE.24.10	Heape on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let
b.EZE.24.11	Then set it empty vpon the coales thereof, that the brasse of it may be hot
b.EZE.24.12	She hath wearied herselfe with lies, and her great scumme went not forth out
b.EZE.24.13	In thy filthinesse is lewdnesse, because I haue purged thee, and thou wast
b.EZE.24.14	I the Lord haue spoken it, it shall come to passe, and I will doe it, I will
b.EZE.24.15	Also the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.24.16	Sonne of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a
b.EZE.24.17	Forbeare to crie, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head
b.EZE.24.18	So I spake vnto the people in the morning, and at euen my wife died, and I
b.EZE.24.19	And the people said vnto me; Wilt thou not tell vs what these things are to
b.EZE.24.2	Sonne of man, Write thee the name of the day, euen of this same day: the king
b.EZE.24.20	Then I answered them, The word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.24.21	Speake vnto the house of Israel; Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will
b.EZE.24.22	And yee shall doe as I haue done: yee shall not couer your lips, nor eate the
b.EZE.24.23	And your tires shall be vpon your heads, and your shooes vpon your feet: yee
b.EZE.24.24	Thus Ezekiel is vnto you a signe: according to all that he hath done, shall
b.EZE.24.25	Also thou sonne of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them
b.EZE.24.26	That he that escapeth in that day, shall come vnto thee, to cause thee to
b.EZE.24.27	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt
b.EZE.24.3	And vtter a parable vnto the rebellious house, and say vnto them, Thus sayth

b.EZE.31.16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him downe
b.EZE.31.17	They also went downe into hell with him vnto them that be slaine with the
b.EZE.31.18	To whom art thou thus like in glory &amp; in greatnesse among the trees of
b.EZE.3.12	Then the spirit tooke me vp, and I heard behind me a voyce of a great

b.EZE.32.22	Ashur is there, and all her companie: his graues are about him: al of them
b.EZE.32.23	Whose graues are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about
b.EZE.32.24	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her graue, all of them slaine,
b.EZE.32.25	They haue set her a bed in the midst of the slaine with all her multitudes:
b.EZE.32.26	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graues are round about
b.EZE.32.27	And they shall not lie with the mightie, that are fallen of the vncircumcised,
b.EZE.32.28	Yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the vncircumcised, and shalt lie
b.EZE.32.29	There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, which with their might are laid

b.EZE.32.31	Pharaoh shall see them, and shall bee comforted ouer all his multitude, euen
b.EZE.32.32	For I haue caused my terrour in the land of the liuing: and he shall bee laid
b.EZE.3.24	Then the spirit entred into me, and set me vpon my feet, and spake with me,
b.EZE.32.4	Then will I leaue thee vpon the land, I will cast thee forth vpon the open
b.EZE.3.25	But thou, O sonne of man, behold, they shall put bands vpon thee, and shall
b.EZE.32.5	And I will lay thy flesh vpon the mountaines, and fill the valleis with thy
b.EZE.3.26	And I will make thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth, that thou shalt

b.EZE.33.10	Therefore, O thou sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, Thus ye
b.EZE.33.11	Say vnto them, As I liue, saith the Lord God, I haue no pleasure in the death
b.EZE.33.12	Therefore thou sonne of man, say vnto the children of thy people, The

b.EZE.33.16	None of his sinnes that hee hath committed, shall be mentioned vnto him: he
b.EZE.33.17	Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equall: but as
b.EZE.33.18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousnes, and committeth iniquitie,
b.EZE.33.19	But if the wicked turne from his wickednes, and doe that which is lawfull and
b.EZE.33.2	Sonne of man, speake to the children of thy people, and say vnto them, When I
b.EZE.33.20	Yet yee say, The way of the Lord is not equall, O yee house of Israel; I will

b.EZE.33.25	Wherefore say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Ye eate with the blood, and
b.EZE.33.26	Yee stand vpon your sword; yee worke abomination, and ye defile euery one his
b.EZE.33.27	Say thou thus vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, As I liue, surely they that

b.EZE.33.8	When I say vnto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, if thou doest
b.EZE.33.9	Neuerthelesse if thou warne the wicked of his way to turne from it: if he do
b.EZE.3.4	And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, get thee vnto the house of Israel, and
b.EZE.34.1	And the word of ye Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.34.10	Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepheards, and I will
b.EZE.34.11	For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I, euen I will both search my sheepe,
b.EZE.34.12	As a shepheard seeketh out his flocke in the day that hee is among his sheepe
b.EZE.34.13	And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countreys,
b.EZE.34.14	I will feede them in a good pasture, and vpon the high mountaines of Israel
b.EZE.34.15	I will feed my flocke, and I will cause them to lie downe, saith the Lord
b.EZE.34.16	I will seeke that which was lost, and bring againe that which was driuen
b.EZE.34.17	And as for you, O my flocke, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I iudge
b.EZE.34.18	Seemeth it a small thing vnto you, to haue eaten vp the good pasture, but ye
b.EZE.34.19	And as for my flocke, they eate that which yee haue troden with your feete:
b.EZE.34.2	Sonne of man, prophecie against the shepheards of Israel, prophecie and say
b.EZE.34.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God vnto them, Behold, I, euen I will iudge
b.EZE.34.21	Because yee haue thrust with side and with shoulder, and pusht all the
b.EZE.34.22	Therefore will I saue my flocke, and they shall no more be a pray, and I will
b.EZE.34.23	And I will set vp one shepheard ouer them, and hee shall feede them, euen my
b.EZE.34.24	And I the Lord will be their God, and my seruant Dauid a prince among them, I
b.EZE.34.25	And I will make with them a couenant of peace, and will cause the euill
b.EZE.34.26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill, a blessing; and I
b.EZE.34.27	And the tree of the field shal yeeld her fruite, and the earth shall yeeld
b.EZE.34.28	And they shall no more be a pray to the heathen, neither shall the beasts of
b.EZE.34.29	And I will raise vp for them a plant of renowne, and they shall be no more
b.EZE.34.3	Yee eate the fat, and ye clothe you with the wooll, yee kill them that are
b.EZE.34.30	Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they,
b.EZE.34.31	And yee my flocke of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord
b.EZE.34.4	The diseased haue ye not strengthened, neither haue yee healed that which was
b.EZE.34.5	And they were scattered because there is no shepheard: and they became meate
b.EZE.34.6	My sheepe wandered through all the mountaines, and vpon euery high hill: yea
b.EZE.34.7	Therefore, yee shepheards, heare the word of the Lord.
b.EZE.34.8	As I liue, saith the Lord God, surely because my flocke became a pray, and my
b.EZE.34.9	Therefore, O yee shepheards, heare the word of the Lord.
b.EZE.3.5	For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech, and of an hard
b.EZE.35.1	Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto mee, saying;
b.EZE.35.10	Because thou hast said; These two nations, and these two countries shall be
b.EZE.35.11	Therefore, as I liue, saith the Lord God, I will euen doe according to thine
b.EZE.35.12	And thou shalt know, that I am the Lord, and that I haue heard all thy
b.EZE.35.13	Thus with your mouth yee haue boasted against me, &amp; haue multiplied your
b.EZE.35.14	Thus saith the Lord God; When the whole earth reioyceth, I will make thee
b.EZE.35.15	As thou didst reioyce at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it
b.EZE.35.2	Sonne of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophecie against it,
b.EZE.35.3	And say vnto it, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against
b.EZE.35.4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know
b.EZE.35.5	Because thou hast had a perpetuall hatred, and hast shed the blood of the
b.EZE.35.6	Therefore, as I liue, saith the Lord God, I will prepare thee vnto blood, and
b.EZE.35.7	Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that
b.EZE.35.8	And I will fill his mountaines with his slaine men: in thy hilles, and in thy
b.EZE.35.9	I will make thee perpetuall desolations, &amp; thy cities shall not returne,
b.EZE.3.6	Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words
b.EZE.36.1	Also thou sonne of man, prophecie vnto the mountaines of Israel, and say; Ye
b.EZE.36.10	And I will multiplie men vpon you, all the house of Israel, euen all of it,
b.EZE.36.11	And I will multiply vpon you man and beast, and they shall increase and bring
b.EZE.36.12	Yea I will cause men to walke vpon you, euen my people Israel, and they shall
b.EZE.36.13	Thus saith the Lord God, Because they say vnto you, Thou land deuourest vp
b.EZE.36.14	Therefore thou shalt deuoure men no more, neither bereaue thy nations any
b.EZE.36.15	Neither will I cause men to heare in thee the shame of the heathen any more,
b.EZE.36.16	Moreouer the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.EZE.36.17	Sonne of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled
b.EZE.36.18	Wherefore I powred my furie vpon them for the blood that they had shed vpon
b.EZE.36.19	And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the
b.EZE.36.2	Thus saith the Lord God, Because the enemy had said against you, Aha, euen the
b.EZE.36.20	And when they entred vnto the heathen whither they went, they prophaned my
b.EZE.36.21	But I had pitie for mine holy Name, which the house of Israel had prophaned
b.EZE.36.22	Therefore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, I doe not
b.EZE.36.23	And I will sanctifie my great Name which was prophaned among the heathen,
b.EZE.36.24	For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all
b.EZE.36.25	Then will I sprinckle cleane water vpon you, and ye shalbe cleane: from all
b.EZE.36.26	A new heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and
b.EZE.36.27	And I wil put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my Statutes,
b.EZE.36.28	And ye shall dwel in the land that I gaue to your fathers, and ye shall be my
b.EZE.36.29	I wil also saue you from all your vncleannesses, and I will call for the
b.EZE.36.3	Therfore prophecie and say, Thus saith the Lord God, Because they haue made
b.EZE.36.30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field,
b.EZE.36.31	Then shall yee remember your owne euil waies, and your doings that were not
b.EZE.36.32	Not for your sakes doe I this, saith the Lord God, be it knowen vnto you: be
b.EZE.36.33	Thus saith the Lord God, In the day that I shall haue cleansed you from all
b.EZE.36.34	And the desolate land shalbe tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of
b.EZE.36.35	And they shall say, This land that was desolate, is become like the garden of
b.EZE.36.36	Then the heathen that are left round about you, shall know that I the Lord
b.EZE.36.37	Thus saith the Lord God, I wil yet for this bee enquired of by the house of
b.EZE.36.38	As the holy flocke, as the flocke of Ierusalem in her solemne feastes, so
b.EZE.36.4	Therefore ye mountaines of Israel, heare the word of the Lord God, Thus saith
b.EZE.36.5	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Surely in the fire of my ielousie haue I
b.EZE.36.6	Prophecie therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say vnto the mountaines
b.EZE.36.7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, I haue lifted vp mine hand, Surely the
b.EZE.36.8	But ye, O mountaines of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yeeld
b.EZE.36.9	For behold, I am for you, and I will turne vnto you, and ye shall be tilled
b.EZE.3.7	But the house of Israel will not hearken vnto thee; for they will not hearken
b.EZE.37.1	The hand of the Lord was vpon mee, and caried mee out in the Spirit of the
b.EZE.37.10	So I prophecied as he commanded mee, and the breath came into them, and they
b.EZE.37.11	Then he said vnto me, Sonne of man, these bones are the whole house of
b.EZE.37.12	Therefore prophecie and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, O my
b.EZE.37.13	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I haue opened your graues, O my
b.EZE.37.14	And shall put my spirit in you, and yee shall liue, and I shall place you in
b.EZE.37.15	The word of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.37.16	Moreouer thou sonne of man, take thee one sticke, and write vpon it, For
b.EZE.37.17	And ioyne them one to another into one sticke, and they shall become one in
b.EZE.37.18	And when the children of thy people shall speake vnto thee, saying, Wilt thou
b.EZE.37.19	Say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will take the sticke of
b.EZE.37.2	And caused mee to passe by them round about, and beholde, there were very many
b.EZE.37.20	And the stickes whereon thou writest, shalbe in thine hand before their eyes.
b.EZE.37.21	And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will take the children
b.EZE.37.22	And I will make them one nation in the land vpon the mountaines of Israel,
b.EZE.37.23	Neither shall they defile themselues any more with their idoles, nor with
b.EZE.37.24	And Dauid my seruant shall be King ouer them, and they all shall haue one
b.EZE.37.25	And they shall dwell in the land that I haue giuen vnto Iacob my seruant,
b.EZE.37.26	Moreouer I will make a couenant of peace with them, it shall be an
b.EZE.37.27	My Tabernacle also shalbe with them: yea, I will be their God, and they
b.EZE.37.28	And the heathen shal know that I the Lord doe sanctifie Israel, when my
b.EZE.37.3	And hee said vnto mee, Sonne of man, can these bones liue? and I answered, O
b.EZE.37.4	Againe he said vnto me, Prophecie vpon these bones, and say vnto them; O yee
b.EZE.37.5	Thus saith the Lord God vnto these bones, Behold, I wil cause breath to enter
b.EZE.37.6	And I wil lay sinewes vpon you, and wil bring vp flesh vpon you, and couer you
b.EZE.37.7	So I prophecied as I was commanded: and as I prophecied, there was a noise,
b.EZE.37.8	And when I beheld, loe, the sinews and the flesh came vp vpon them, and the
b.EZE.37.9	Then said he vnto mee, Prophecie vnto the winde, prophecie sonne of man, and
b.EZE.3.8	Behold, I haue made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead
b.EZE.38.1	And the word of ye Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.EZE.38.10	Thus saith the Lord God; It shall also come to passe, that at the same time
b.EZE.38.11	And thou shalt say: I will goe vp to the land of vnwalled villages; I will
b.EZE.38.12	To take a spoile, and to take a praye, to turne thine hand vpon the desolate
b.EZE.38.13	Sheba, and Dedan, and the marchants of Tarshish, with all the young lyons
b.EZE.38.14	Therefore, sonne of man, prophecie and say vnto Gog, Thus saith the Lord God;
b.EZE.38.15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the North parts, thou and many
b.EZE.38.16	And thou shalt come vp against my people of Israel, as a cloud to couer the
b.EZE.38.17	Thus saith the Lord God; Art thou hee, of whom I haue spoken in old time by
b.EZE.38.18	And it shall come to passe at the same time, when Gog shal come against the
b.EZE.38.19	For in my iealousie, and in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken: surely in
b.EZE.38.2	Sonne of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog the chiefe prince of
b.EZE.38.20	So that the fishes of the sea, and the foules of the heauen, and the beasts
b.EZE.38.21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountaines, saith
b.EZE.38.22	And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood, and I will raine
b.EZE.38.23	Thus will I magnifie my selfe, and sanctifie my selfe, and I will be knowen
b.EZE.38.3	And say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chiefe
b.EZE.38.4	And I will turne thee backe, and put hookes into thy chawes, and I will bring
b.EZE.38.5	Persia, Ethiopia and Libya with them; all of them with shield &amp; helmet:
b.EZE.38.6	Gomer and all his bandes, the house of Togarmah of the North quarters, and all
b.EZE.38.7	Be thou prepared, and prepare for thy selfe, thou and all thy company, that
b.EZE.38.8	After many daies thou shalt be visited: in the latter yeeres thou shalt come
b.EZE.38.9	Thou shalt ascend and come like a storme, thou shalt be like a cloud to couer
b.EZE.3.9	As an adamant harder then flint haue I made thy forehead: feare them not,
b.EZE.39.1	Therefore thou sonne of man, prophecie against Gog, and say, Thus saith the
b.EZE.39.10	So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut downe any out
b.EZE.39.11	And it shal come to passe at that day, that I will giue vnto Gog a place
b.EZE.39.12	And seuen moneths shall the house of Israel bee burying of them, that they
b.EZE.39.13	Yea all the people of the land shall burie them, and it shall be to them a
b.EZE.39.14	And they shall seuer out men of continual emploiment, passing through the
b.EZE.39.15	And the passengers that passe through the lande, when any seeth a mans bone,
b.EZE.39.16	And also the name of the citie shall be Hamonah: thus shal they clense the
b.EZE.39.17	And thou sonne of man, Thus saith the Lord God, Speake vnto euery feathered
b.EZE.39.18	Ye shall eate the flesh of the mightie, and drinke the blood of the princes
b.EZE.39.19	And yee shall eate fat till yee be full, and drinke blood till yee be
b.EZE.39.2	And I will turne thee backe, and leaue but the sixt part of thee, and will
b.EZE.39.20	Thus yee shall be filled at my table with horses and charets, with mightie
b.EZE.39.21	And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shal see my
b.EZE.39.22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day
b.EZE.39.23	And the heathen shall knowe that the house of Israel went into captiuitie for
b.EZE.39.24	According to their vncleannesse, and according to their transgressions haue I
b.EZE.39.25	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Now will I bring againe the captiuitie of
b.EZE.39.26	After that they haue borne their shame, and all their trespasses, wherby they
b.EZE.39.27	When I haue brought them againe from the people, and gathered them out of
b.EZE.39.28	Then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, which caused them to be
b.EZE.39.29	Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I haue powred out my
b.EZE.39.3	And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrowes to
b.EZE.39.4	Thou shalt fall vpon the mountaines of Israel, thou &amp; all thy bands, and
b.EZE.39.5	Thou shalt fall vpon the open field, for I haue spoken it, saith the Lord God.
b.EZE.39.6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelesly in the
b.EZE.39.7	So will I make my holy Name knowen in the midst of my people Israel, and I
b.EZE.39.8	Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God, this is the day
b.EZE.39.9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel, shall goe forth, and shall set on

b.EZE.40.20	And the gate of the outward court, that looked toward the North, he measured
b.EZE.40.21	And the little chambers thereof were three on this side, and three on that
b.EZE.40.22	And their windowes, and their arches, and their palme trees, were after the
b.EZE.40.23	And the gate of the inner court was ouer against the gate toward the North
b.EZE.40.24	After that hee brought me toward the South, and behold a gate toward the

b.EZE.40.29	And the little chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches
b.EZE.40.3	And he brought mee thither, and behold, there was a man, whose appearance was

b.EZE.40.46	And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North, is for the priests the
b.EZE.40.47	So he measured the court, an hundreth cubites long, and an hundreth cubites
b.EZE.40.48	And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the

b.EZE.40.9	Then measured hee the porch of the gate, eight cubites, and the postes thereof
b.EZE.4.1	Thou also sonne of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray
b.EZE.4.10	And thy meate which thou shalt eat, shalbe by weight twentie shekels a day:
b.EZE.4.11	Thou shalt drinke also water by measure, the sixt part of an hin: from time
b.EZE.41.1	Afterward he brought me to the Temple, and measured the posts, six cubites
b.EZE.41.10	And betweene the chambers was the widenesse of twentie cubites round about
b.EZE.41.11	And the doores of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one

b.EZE.41.14	Also the bredth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward
b.EZE.41.15	And he measured the length of the building ouer against the separate place
b.EZE.41.16	The doore-posts and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on
b.EZE.41.17	To that aboue the doore, euen vnto the inner house and without, and by all

b.EZE.4.14	Then said I, Ah Lord God, behold, my soule hath not bene polluted: for from
b.EZE.41.4	So he measured the length therof twentie cubites, and the bredth twentie

b.EZE.4.17	That they may want bread and water, &amp; be astonied one with an other, and
b.EZE.41.7	And there was an enlarging and a winding about still vpward to the
b.EZE.41.8	I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the
b.EZE.41.9	The thicknesse of the wall which was for the side chamber without, was fiue
b.EZE.4.2	And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount

b.EZE.42.19	Hee turned about to the West side, and measured fiue hundreth reedes with the
b.EZE.42.2	Before the length of an hundreth cubites was the North doore, and the breadth
b.EZE.42.20	He measured it by the foure sides: it had a wall round about fiue hundreth
b.EZE.42.3	Ouer against the twentie cubites which were for the inner court, and ouer
b.EZE.42.4	And before the chambers was a walke of ten cubites breadth inward, a way of
b.EZE.42.5	Now the vpper-chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher then these,
b.EZE.42.6	For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the

b.EZE.42.8	For the length of the chambers that were in the vtter court was fiftie cubites:
b.EZE.42.9	And from vnder these chambers was the entrie on the East side, as one goeth
b.EZE.4.3	Moreouer take thou vnto thee an yron panne, and set it for a wall of yron
b.EZE.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, euen the gate that looketh toward the
b.EZE.43.10	Thou sonne of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be

b.EZE.43.15	So the Altar shalbe foure cubites, and from the altar and vpward shalbe foure
b.EZE.43.16	And the altar shalbe twelue cubites long, twelue broad, square in the foure
b.EZE.43.17	And the settle shall bee fourteene cubites long, and fourteene broad in the
b.EZE.43.18	And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, thus saith the Lord God, These are the
b.EZE.43.19	And thou shalt giue to the Priests the Leuites that be of the seede of Zadok,
b.EZE.43.2	And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the East: and
b.EZE.43.20	And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the foure hornes of
b.EZE.43.21	Thou shalt take the bullocke also of the sinne offering, and he shall burne
b.EZE.43.22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a kidde of the goats without blemish
b.EZE.43.23	When thou hast made an ende of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a yong bullocke
b.EZE.43.24	And thou shalt offer them before the Lord, and the Priests shall cast salt
b.EZE.43.25	Seuen dayes shalt thou prepare euery day a goate for a sinne offering: they
b.EZE.43.26	Seuen dayes shal they purge the Altar and purifie it, and they shall
b.EZE.43.27	And when these dayes are expired, it shall be that vpon the eight day and so
b.EZE.43.3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, euen
b.EZE.43.4	And the glorie of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate, whose
b.EZE.43.5	So the Spirit tooke me vp, and brought mee into the inner court, and behold,
b.EZE.43.6	And I heard him speaking vnto me out of the house, &amp; the man stood by me.
b.EZE.43.7	And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, the place of my throne, and the place of
b.EZE.43.8	In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my
b.EZE.43.9	Now let them put away their whoredome, and the carkeises of their kings farre
b.EZE.4.4	Lie thou also vpon thy left side, and lay the iniquitie of the house of Israel
b.EZE.44.1	Then he brought me backe the way of the gate of the outward Sanctuarie which
b.EZE.44.10	And the Leuites that are gone away farre from me, when Israel went astray,
b.EZE.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my Sanctuary, hauing charge at the gates of
b.EZE.44.12	Because they ministred vnto them before their idoles, and caused the house of
b.EZE.44.13	And they shall not come neere vnto me to doe the office of a priest vnto me,
b.EZE.44.14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the seruice
b.EZE.44.15	But the priests the Leuites, the sonnes of Zadok, that kept the charge of my
b.EZE.44.16	They shall enter into my sanctuarie, and they shall come neere to my table to
b.EZE.44.17	And it shall come to passe that when they enter in at the gates of the inner
b.EZE.44.18	They shall haue linnen bonets vpon their heads, and shall haue linnen
b.EZE.44.19	And when they goe forth into the vtter court, euen into the vtter court to
b.EZE.44.2	Then said the Lord vnto me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened,
b.EZE.44.20	Neither shall they shaue their heads, nor suffer their lockes to grow long,
b.EZE.44.21	Neither shall any priest drinke wine, when they enter into the inner court.
b.EZE.44.22	Neither shall they take for their wiues a widow, or her that is put away: but
b.EZE.44.23	And they shall teach my people the difference betweene the holy and prophane,
b.EZE.44.24	And in controuersie they shall stand in iudgement, and they shall iudge it
b.EZE.44.25	And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselues: but for father or

b.EZE.44.27	And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuarie, vnto the inner court to

b.EZE.44.31	The priests shall not eate of any thing that is dead of it selfe or torne,
b.EZE.44.4	Then brought he me the way of the North gate before the house, and I looked,
b.EZE.44.5	And the Lord said vnto me; Sonne of man, marke well, and behold with thine
b.EZE.44.6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, euen to the house of Israel, Thus sayth
b.EZE.44.7	In that ye haue brought into my Sanctuarie strangers vncircumcised in heart,
b.EZE.44.8	And yee haue not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye haue set keepers
b.EZE.44.9	Thus sayth the Lord God, No stranger vncircumcised in heart, nor vncircumcised
b.EZE.4.5	For I haue layed vpon thee the yeeres of their iniquitie, according to the
b.EZE.45.1	Moreouer, when yee shall diuide by lot the land for inheritance, yee shall
b.EZE.45.10	Ye shall haue iust ballances, and a iust Ephah, and a iust Bath.
b.EZE.45.11	The Ephah and the Bath shal be of one measure, that the Bath may containe the

b.EZE.45.15	And one lambe out of the flocke, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures
b.EZE.45.16	All the people of the land shall giue this oblation for the prince in Israel.
b.EZE.45.17	And it shall be the princes part to giue burnt offerings, and meat offrings,
b.EZE.45.18	Thus saith the Lord God, In the first moneth, in the first day of the moneth,
b.EZE.45.19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sinne offering, and put it vpon
b.EZE.45.2	Of this there shal be for the Sanctuarie fiue hundreth in length, with fiue
b.EZE.45.20	And so thou shalt doe the seuenth day of the moneth, for euery one that
b.EZE.45.21	In the first moneth, in the fourteenth day of the moneth, ye shall haue the

b.EZE.45.6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the citie fiue thousand broad, and fiue
b.EZE.45.7	And a portion shalbe for the prince on the one side, and on the other side of
b.EZE.45.8	In the land shall be his possession in Israel, and my princes shall no more
b.EZE.45.9	Thus saith the Lord God, Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remoue
b.EZE.4.6	And when thou hast accomplished them, lie againe on thy right side, and thou
b.EZE.46.1	Thus saith the Lord God, The gate of the inner court, that looketh toward the
b.EZE.46.10	And the Prince in the midst of them when they goe in, shal goe in, and when
b.EZE.46.11	And in the feasts, and in the solemnities, the meat offering shalbe an Ephah
b.EZE.46.12	Now when the Prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace
b.EZE.46.13	Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering vnto the Lord, of a lambe of the

b.EZE.46.15	Thus shall they prepare the lambe, and the meat offering, and the oyle, euery

b.EZE.46.18	Moreouer, the Prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppression,
b.EZE.46.19	After, he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate,
b.EZE.46.2	And the Prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and
b.EZE.46.20	Then said hee vnto me, This is the place where the Priests shall boyle the

b.EZE.46.23	And there was a new building round about in them, round about them foure and
b.EZE.46.24	Then said he vnto me, These are the places of them that boyle, where the

b.EZE.7.17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shalbe weake as water.
b.EZE.7.18	They shall also girde themselues with sackcloth, and horrour shall couer

b.EZE.7.22	My face will I turne also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place:
b.EZE.7.23	Make a chaine: for the land is full of bloody crimes, the citie is full of
b.EZE.7.24	Wherfore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possesse their
b.EZE.7.25	Destruction commeth, and they shall seeke peace, and there shall be none.
b.EZE.7.26	Mischiefe shall come vpon mischiefe, and rumour shall be vpon rumour, then
b.EZE.7.27	The king shall mourne, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and
b.EZE.7.3	Now is the ende come vpon thee, and I will send mine anger vpon thee, and will

b.EZE.7.9	And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I haue pitie: I will recompense
b.EZE.8.1	And it came to passe in the sixt yeere, in the sixt moneth, in the fift day of
b.EZE.8.10	So I went in and saw, and behold euery forme of creeping things, and
b.EZE.8.11	And there stood before them seuentie men of the ancients of the house of

b.EZE.8.7	And hee brought me to the doore of the court, and when I looked, behold a hole
b.EZE.8.8	Then said he vnto me, Sonne of man, digge now in the wall: and when I had

b.EZE.9.6	Slay vtterly olde and yong; both maides, and litle children, and women: but
b.EZE.9.7	And hee sayd vnto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slaine,

b.EZR.9.10	And now, O our God, what shal we say after this? for we haue forsaken thy
b.EZR.9.11	Which thou hast commanded by thy seruants the prophets, saying, The land vnto
b.EZR.9.12	Nowe therefore giue not your daughters vnto their sonnes, neither take their
b.EZR.9.13	And after all that is come vpon vs, for our euill deeds, and for our great
b.EZR.9.14	Should wee againe breake thy commandements, and ioyne in affinitie with the
b.EZR.9.15	O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous, for wee remaine yet escaped, as it
b.EZR.9.2	For they haue taken of their daughters for themselues, and for their sonnes:
b.EZR.9.3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and pluckt off
b.EZR.9.4	Then were assembled vnto me euery one that trembled at the words of the God of
b.EZR.9.5	And at the euening sacrifice, I arose vp from my heauinesse, and hauing rent
b.EZR.9.6	And said, O my God, I am ashamed, and blush to lift vp my face to thee, my
b.EZR.9.7	Since the dayes of our fathers, haue wee beene in a great trespasse vnto this
b.EZR.9.8	And now for a litle space grace hath bene shewed from the Lord our God, to
b.EZR.9.9	For wee were bondmen, yet our God hath not forsaken vs in our bondage, but
b.GAL.1.1	Paul an Apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Iesus Christ, and God the
b.GAL.1.10	For doe I now perswade men, or God? or doe I seeke to please men? For if I
b.GAL.1.11	But I certifie you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is
b.GAL.1.12	For I neither receiued it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the
b.GAL.1.13	For yee haue heard of my couuersation in time past, in the Iewes Religion,
b.GAL.1.14	And profited in the Iewes Religion, aboue many my equals in mine owne nation,
b.GAL.1.15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers wombe, and called
b.GAL.1.16	To reueale his sonne in mee, that I might preach him among the heathen,
b.GAL.1.17	Neither went I vp to Ierusalem, to them which were Apostles before me, but I
b.GAL.1.18	Then after three yeeres, I went vp to Ierusalem to see Peter, and abode with
b.GAL.1.19	But other of the Apostles saw I none, saue Iames the Lords brother.
b.GAL.1.2	And all the brethren which are with mee, vnto the Churches of Galatia:
b.GAL.1.20	Now the things which I write vnto you, behold, before God I lye not.
b.GAL.1.21	Afterwards I came into the regions of
b.GAL.1.22	And was vnknowen by face vnto the Churches of Iudea, which were in Christ.
b.GAL.1.23	But they had heard onely, that he which persecuted vs in times past, now
b.GAL.1.24	And they glorified God in me.
b.GAL.1.3	Grace bee to you and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Iesus
b.GAL.1.4	Who gaue himselfe for our sinnes, that he might deliuer vs from this present
b.GAL.1.5	To whom bee glorie for euer and euer, Amen.
b.GAL.1.6	I marueile, that you are so soone remoued from him, that called you into the
b.GAL.1.7	Which is not another; but there bee some that trouble you, and would peruert
b.GAL.1.8	But though we, or an Angel from heauen, preach any other Gospel vnto you, then
b.GAL.1.9	As we said before, so say I now againe, If any man preach any other Gospel
b.GAL.2.1	Then fourteene yeeres after, I went vp againe to Ierusalem with Barnabas, and
b.GAL.2.10	Onely they would that wee should remember the poore, the same which I also
b.GAL.2.11	But when Peter was come to
b.GAL.2.12	For before that certaine came from Iames, he did eate with the Gentiles: but
b.GAL.2.13	And the other Iewes dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also
b.GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they walked not vprightly according to the truth of the
b.GAL.2.15	We who are Iewes by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
b.GAL.2.16	Knowing that a man is not iustified by the works of the Law, but by the faith
b.GAL.2.17	But if while we seeke to be iustified by Christ, wee our selues also are
b.GAL.2.18	For if I build againe the things which I destroyed, I make my selfe a
b.GAL.2.19	For I through ye Law, am dead to the Law, that I might liue vnto God.
b.GAL.2.2	And I went vp by reuelation, and communicated vnto them that Gospel, which I
b.GAL.2.20	I am crucified with Christ. Neuertheles, I liue, yet not I, but Christ liueth
b.GAL.2.21	I doe not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousnes come by the Lawe,
b.GAL.2.3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greeke, was compelled to be
b.GAL.2.4	And that because of false brethren vnawares brought in, who came in priuily to
b.GAL.2.5	To whom wee gaue place by subiection, no not for an houre, that the trueth of
b.GAL.2.6	But of these, who seemed to bee somewhat, (whatsoeuer they were, it maketh no
b.GAL.2.7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the Gospel of the vncircumcision was
b.GAL.2.8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of the
b.GAL.2.9	And when Iames, Cephas and Iohn, who seemed to bee pillars, perceiued the
b.GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the
b.GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the lawe, are vnder the curse: for it is
b.GAL.3.11	But that no man is iustified by the Lawe in the sight of God, it is euident:
b.GAL.3.12	And the Law is not of faith: but the man that doeth them, shall liue in them.
b.GAL.3.13	Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for vs:
b.GAL.3.14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles, through Iesus
b.GAL.3.15	Brethren, I speake after the maner of men: though it be but a mans couenant,
b.GAL.3.16	Now to Abraham and his seede were the promises made. He saith not, And to
b.GAL.3.17	And this I say, that the Couenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ,
b.GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance bee of the Law, it is no more of promise: but God gaue
b.GAL.3.19	Wherefore then serueth the Law? it was added because of transgressions, till
b.GAL.3.2	This onely would I learne of you, receiued ye the spirit, by the works of the
b.GAL.3.20	Now a mediatour is not a Mediatour of one, but God is one.
b.GAL.3.21	Is the Lawe then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had
b.GAL.3.22	But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise by faith
b.GAL.3.23	But before faith came, wee were kept vnder the Law, shut vp vnto the faith,
b.GAL.3.24	Wherefore the Law was our Schoolemaster to bring vs vnto Christ, that we
b.GAL.3.25	But after that Faith is come, we are no longer vnder a Schoolemaster.
b.GAL.3.26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Iesus.
b.GAL.3.27	For as many of you as haue bene baptized into Christ, haue put on Christ.
b.GAL.3.28	There is neither Iewe, nor Greeke, there is neither bond nor free, there is
b.GAL.3.29	And if yee be Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, and heires according to the
b.GAL.3.3	Are ye so foolish? Hauing begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the
b.GAL.3.4	Haue ye suffered so many things in vaine? If it be yet in vaine.
b.GAL.3.5	He therfore that ministreth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you,
b.GAL.3.6	Euen as Abraham beleeued God, and it was accounted to him for righteousnesse.
b.GAL.3.7	Knowe yee therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children
b.GAL.3.8	And the Scripture foreseeing that God would iustifie the heathen through
b.GAL.3.9	So then, they which bee of faith, are blessed with faithfull Abraham.
b.GAL.4.1	Now I say, that the heire, as long as hee is a child, differeth nothing from a
b.GAL.4.10	Yee obserue dayes, and moneths, and times, and yeeres.
b.GAL.4.11	I am afraide of you, lest I haue bestowed vpon you labour in vaine.
b.GAL.4.12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are, ye haue not iniured
b.GAL.4.13	Ye know how through infirmitie of the flesh, I preached the Gospel vnto you
b.GAL.4.14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor reiected, but
b.GAL.4.15	Where is then the blessednes you spake of? for I beare you record, that if it
b.GAL.4.16	Am I therefore become your enemie, because I tell you the trueth?
b.GAL.4.17	They zelously affect you, but not well: yea, they would exclude you, that you
b.GAL.4.18	But it is good to bee zealously affected alwayes in a good thing, and not
b.GAL.4.19	My litle children, of whom I trauaile in birth againe, vntill Christ bee
b.GAL.4.2	But is vnder tutors and gouernours vntill the time appointed of the father.
b.GAL.4.20	I desire to bee present with you now, and to change my voyce, for I stand in
b.GAL.4.21	Tell me, ye that desire to be vnder the Law, doe ye not heare the Law?
b.GAL.4.22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sonnes, the one by a bondmaid, the
b.GAL.4.23	But he who was of the bondwoman, was borne after the flesh: but hee of the
b.GAL.4.24	Which things are an Allegorie; for these are the two Couenants; the one from
b.GAL.4.25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in
b.GAL.4.26	But Ierusalem which is aboue is free, which is the mother of vs all.
b.GAL.4.27	For it is written, Reioyce thou barren that bearest not, breake foorth and
b.GAL.4.28	Now wee, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
b.GAL.4.29	But as then hee that was borne after the flesh, persecuted him that was borne
b.GAL.4.3	Euen so we, when wee were children, were in bondage vnder the Elements of the
b.GAL.4.30	Neuerthelesse, what saith the Scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her sonne:
b.GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
b.GAL.4.4	But when the fulnes of the time was come, God sent foorth his Sonne made of a
b.GAL.4.5	To redeeme them that were vnder the Law, that we might receiue the adoption of
b.GAL.4.6	And because yee are sonnes, God hath sent foorth the spirit of his Sonne into
b.GAL.4.7	Wherefore thou art no more a seruant, but a sonne; and if a sonne, then an
b.GAL.4.8	Howbeit, then when ye knew not God, yee did seruice vnto them which by nature
b.GAL.4.9	But now after that yee haue knowen God, or rather are knowen of God, how turne
b.GAL.5.1	Stand fast therefore in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made vs free, and
b.GAL.5.10	I haue confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise
b.GAL.5.11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why doe I yet suffer
b.GAL.5.12	I would they were euen cut off which trouble you.
b.GAL.5.13	For brethren, ye haue beene called vnto liberty, onely vse not libertie for
b.GAL.5.14	For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, euen in this: Thou shalt loue thy
b.GAL.5.15	But if yee bite and deuoure one another, take heed ye be not consumed one of
b.GAL.5.16	This I say then, Walke in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of
b.GAL.5.17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the spirit against the flesh:
b.GAL.5.18	But if yee be lead of the spirit, yee are not vnder the Law.
b.GAL.5.19	Nowe the workes of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adulterie,
b.GAL.5.2	Beholde, I Paul say vnto you that if ye be circumcised, Christ shal profite
b.GAL.5.20	Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
b.GAL.5.21	Enuyings, murthers, drunkennesse, reuellings, and such like: of the which I
b.GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the spirit is loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, gentlenesse,
b.GAL.5.23	Meekenesse, temperance: against such there is no law.
b.GAL.5.24	And they that are Christs, haue crucified the flesh with the affections and
b.GAL.5.25	If we liue in the Spirit, let vs also walke in the Spirit.
b.GAL.5.26	Let vs not be desirous of vaine glory, prouoking one another, enuying one
b.GAL.5.3	For I testifie againe to euery man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to
b.GAL.5.4	Christ is become of no effect vnto you, whosoeuer of you are iustified by the
b.GAL.5.5	For we through the spirit waite for the hope of righteousnesse by faith.
b.GAL.5.6	For in Iesus Christ, neither circumcision auaileth any thing, nor
b.GAL.5.7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you, that ye should not obey the trueth?
b.GAL.5.8	This perswasion commeth not of him that calleth you.
b.GAL.5.9	A little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe.
b.GAL.6.1	Brethren, if a man bee ouertaken in a fault: yee which are spirituall, restore
b.GAL.6.10	As we haue therefore opportunitie, let vs doe good vnto all men, especially
b.GAL.6.11	Ye see how large a letter I haue written vnto you with mine owne hand.
b.GAL.6.12	As many as desire to make a faire shew in the flesh, they constraine you to
b.GAL.6.13	For neither they themselues who are circumcised, keepe the Law, but desire to
b.GAL.6.14	But God forbid that I should glory, saue in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus
b.GAL.6.15	For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision auaileth any thing nor
b.GAL.6.16	And as many as walke according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercie,
b.GAL.6.17	From henceforth let no man trouble mee, for I beare in my body the markes of
b.GAL.6.18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
b.GAL.6.2	Beare ye one anothers burthens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.
b.GAL.6.3	For if a man thinke himselfe to be something, when he is nothing, hee
b.GAL.6.4	But let euery man prooue his owne worke, and then shall he haue reioycing in
b.GAL.6.5	For euery man shall beare his owne burthen.
b.GAL.6.6	Let him that is taught in the word, communicate vnto him that teacheth, in all
b.GAL.6.7	Be not deceiued, God is not mocked: for whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shall he

b.GEN.10.5	By these were the Iles of the Gentiles diuided in their lands, euery one after
b.GEN.10.6	And the sonnes of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
b.GEN.10.7	And the sonnes of Cush, Seba, and Hauilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and
b.GEN.10.8	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
b.GEN.10.9	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is saide, Euen as Nimrod
b.GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the Heauen, and the Earth.
b.GEN.1.10	And God called the drie land, Earth, and the gathering together of the waters
b.GEN.1.11	And God said, Let the Earth bring foorth grasse, the herbe yeelding seed, and
b.GEN.11.1	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speach.
b.GEN.11.10	These are the generations of Shem. Shem was an hundred yeres old, and begate
b.GEN.11.11	And Shem liued, after he begate Arphaxad, fiue hundred yeeres, and begate

b.GEN.11.27	Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begate Abram, Nahor, and Haran:
b.GEN.11.28	And Haran died, before his father Terah in the land of his natiuity, in Ur of

b.GEN.11.3	And they sayd one to another; Goe to, let vs make bricke, and burne them
b.GEN.11.30	But Sarai was barren; she had no childe.
b.GEN.11.31	And Terah tooke Abram his sonne, and Lot the sonne of Haran his sonnes sonne,
b.GEN.11.32	And the dayes of Terah, were two hundred and fiue yeres: and Terah died in

b.GEN.1.19	And the euening and the morning were the fourth day.
b.GEN.11.9	Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD did there confound
b.GEN.1.2	And the earth was without forme, and voyd, and darkenesse was vpon the face of

b.GEN.12.12	Therefore it shall come to passe, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that
b.GEN.12.13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be wel with me, for thy

b.GEN.12.15	The Princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and
b.GEN.12.16	And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheepe, and oxen, and
b.GEN.12.17	And the LORD plagued Pharaoh &amp; his house with great plagues, because of
b.GEN.12.18	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done vnto me?
b.GEN.12.19	Why saidest thou, Shee is my sister? so I might haue taken her to mee to
b.GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitfull, and multiply, and fill the waters
b.GEN.12.2	And I will make of thee a great nation, and I wil blesse thee, and make thy

b.GEN.12.3	And I will blesse them that blesse thee, and curse him, that curseth thee: and
b.GEN.1.24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the liuing creature after his kinde,
b.GEN.12.4	So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken vnto him, and Lot went with him: And
b.GEN.1.25	And God made the beast of the earth after his kinde, and cattell after their
b.GEN.12.5	And Abram tooke Sarai his wife, and Lot his brothers sonne, and all their

b.GEN.1.27	So God created man in his owne Image, in the Image of God created hee him;
b.GEN.12.7	And the LORD appeared vnto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed wil I giue this
b.GEN.1.28	And God blessed them, and God said vnto them, Be fruitfull, and multiply, and
b.GEN.12.8	And he remoued from thence vnto a mountaine, on the East of Beth-el, and
b.GEN.1.29	And God said, Behold, I haue giuen you euery herbe bearing seede, which is
b.GEN.12.9	And Abram iourneyed, going on still toward the South.
b.GEN.1.3	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
b.GEN.1.30	And to euery beast of the earth, and to euery foule of the aire, and to euery
b.GEN.1.31	And God saw euery thing that hee had made: and behold, it was very good. And
b.GEN.13.1	And Abram went vp out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot
b.GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted vp his eyes, and beheld all the plaine of Iordane, that it was
b.GEN.13.11	Then Lot chose him all the plaine of Iordane: and Lot iourneyed East; and
b.GEN.13.12	Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the
b.GEN.13.13	But the men of Sodome were wicked, and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
b.GEN.13.14	And the LORD said vnto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift vp
b.GEN.13.15	For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seede
b.GEN.13.16	And I will make thy seede as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can
b.GEN.13.17	Arise, walke through the land, in the length of it, and in the breadth of it:
b.GEN.13.18	Then Abram remoued his tent, and came and dwelt in the plaine of Mamre, which
b.GEN.13.2	And Abram was very rich in cattell, in siluer, and in gold.
b.GEN.13.3	And hee went on his iourneyes from the South, euen to Beth-el, vnto the place
b.GEN.13.4	Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there
b.GEN.13.5	And Lot also which went with Abram, had flocks and heards, &amp; tents.
b.GEN.13.6	And the land was not able to beare them, that they might dwell together: for
b.GEN.13.7	And there was a strife betweene the heardmen of Abrams cattell, and the
b.GEN.13.8	And Abram said vnto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, betweene mee and
b.GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thy selfe, I pray thee, from mee:
b.GEN.1.4	And God saw the light, that it was good: and God diuided the light from the
b.GEN.14.1	And it came to passe in the dayes of Amraphel King of Shinar, Arioch King of
b.GEN.14.10	And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits: and the Kings of Sodome &amp;
b.GEN.14.11	And they tooke all the goods of Sodome and Gomorrah, and all their victuals,
b.GEN.14.12	And they tooke Lot, Abrams brothers sonne, (who dwelt in Sodome) and his
b.GEN.14.13	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew, for hee dwelt
b.GEN.14.14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captiue, he armed his trained
b.GEN.14.15	And hee diuided himselfe against them, he and his seruants by night, and
b.GEN.14.16	And hee brought backe all the goods, and also brought againe his brother Lot,
b.GEN.14.17	And the king of Sodome went out to meete him, (after his returne from the
b.GEN.14.18	And Melchizedek King of Salem brought foorth bread and wine: and he was the
b.GEN.14.19	And hee blessed him, and saide; Blessed bee Abram of the most high God,
b.GEN.14.2	That these made warre with Bera King of Sodome, and with Birsha King of
b.GEN.14.20	And blessed bee the most high God, which hath deliuered thine enemies into
b.GEN.14.21	And the King of Sodome said vnto Abram, giue me the persons, and take the
b.GEN.14.22	And Abram said to the King of Sodome, I haue lift vp my hand vnto the LORD,
b.GEN.14.23	That I wil not take from a threed euen to a shoe latchet, and that I will not
b.GEN.14.24	Saue onely that which the yong men haue eaten, and the portion of the men
b.GEN.14.3	All these were ioyned together in the vale of Siddim; which is the salt Sea.
b.GEN.14.4	Twelue yeeres they serued Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth yeere they
b.GEN.14.5	And in the fourteenth yeere came Chedorlaomer, and the Kings that were with
b.GEN.14.6	And the Horites in their mount Seir, vnto El-Paran, which is by the
b.GEN.14.7	And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, &amp; smote all
b.GEN.14.8	And there went out the King of Sodome, and the King of Gomorrah, and the King
b.GEN.14.9	With Chedorlaomer the King of Elam, and with Tidal King of nations, and
b.GEN.1.5	And God called the light, Day, and the darknesse he called Night: and the
b.GEN.15.1	After these things, the word of the LORD came vnto Abram in a vision, saying;
b.GEN.15.10	And he tooke vnto him all these, and diuided them in the midst, and layd each
b.GEN.15.11	And when the fowles came downe vpon the carcases, Abram droue them away.
b.GEN.15.12	And when the Sunne was going downe, a deepe sleepe fell vpon Abram: and loe,
b.GEN.15.13	And he said vnto Abram, Know of a surety, that thy seed shalbe a stranger, in
b.GEN.15.14	And also that nation whom they shall serue, wil I iudge: and afterward shall
b.GEN.15.15	And thou shalt goe to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good
b.GEN.15.16	But in the fourth generation they shall come hither againe: for the iniquitie
b.GEN.15.17	And it came to passe that when the Sunne went downe, and it was darke,
b.GEN.15.18	In that same day the LORD made a couenant with Abram, saying; Unto thy seed
b.GEN.15.19	The Kenites, and the Kenizites, and the Kadmonites:
b.GEN.15.2	And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou giue me, seeing I goe childlesse? and
b.GEN.15.20	And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
b.GEN.15.21	And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Iebusites.
b.GEN.15.3	And Abram said; Behold, to mee thou hast given no seed: and loe, one borne in
b.GEN.15.4	And behold, the word of the LORD came vnto him, saying; This shall not be
b.GEN.15.5	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Looke now towards heauen, and tell
b.GEN.15.6	And he beleeued in the LORD; and hee counted it to him for righteousnesse.
b.GEN.15.7	And he said vnto him; I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Caldees,
b.GEN.15.8	And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shal I know that I shall inherit it?
b.GEN.15.9	And he said vnto him, Take me an heifer of three yeeres old, and a shee goat
b.GEN.1.6	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters: and let it
b.GEN.16.1	Now Sarai Abrams wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaide, an
b.GEN.16.10	And the Angel of the LORD said vnto her, I will multiply thy seede
b.GEN.16.11	And the Angel of the LORD said vnto her, Behold, thou art with child, and
b.GEN.16.12	And he will be a wilde man; his hand will be against euery man, and euery
b.GEN.16.13	And shee called the name of the LORD that spake vnto her, Thou God seest me:
b.GEN.16.14	Wherefore the well was called, Beer-lahai-roi: Behold, It is betweene Cadesh
b.GEN.16.15	And Hagar bare Abram a sonne: and Abram called his sonnes name, which Hagar
b.GEN.16.16	And Abram was fourescore and sixe yeeres old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to
b.GEN.16.2	And Sarai said vnto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from
b.GEN.16.3	And Sarai Abrams wife, tooke Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had
b.GEN.16.4	And he went in vnto Hagar, and she conceiued: And when shee saw that shee had
b.GEN.16.5	And Sarai said vnto Abram, My wrong be vpon thee: I haue giuen my maid into
b.GEN.16.6	But Abram said vnto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; doe to her as it
b.GEN.16.7	And the Angel of the LORD found her by a fountaine of water, in the
b.GEN.16.8	And he said, Hagar Sarais maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou goe?
b.GEN.16.9	And the Angel of the LORD said vnto her, Returne to thy mistresse, and submit
b.GEN.1.7	And God made the firmament; and diuided the waters, which were vnder the
b.GEN.17.1	And when Abram was ninetie yeres old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and
b.GEN.17.10	This is my couenant, which yee shall keepe betweene me and you, and thy seed
b.GEN.17.11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskinne; and it shal be a token
b.GEN.17.12	And he that is eight dayes olde, shalbe circumcised among you, euery man
b.GEN.17.13	He that is borne in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must
b.GEN.17.14	And the vncircumcised man-child, whose flesh of his foreskinne is not

b.GEN.17.16	And I will blesse her, and giue thee a sonne also of her: yea I wil blesse
b.GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell vpon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a
b.GEN.17.18	And Abraham said vnto God, O that Ishmael might liue before thee.
b.GEN.17.19	And God said, Sarah thy wife shall beare thee a sonne in deede, and thou
b.GEN.17.2	And I wil make my couenant betweene me and thee, and will multiply thee
b.GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I haue heard thee: behold, I haue blessed him, and will
b.GEN.17.21	But my couenant wil I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall beare vnto
b.GEN.17.22	And he left off talking with him, and God went vp from Abraham.
b.GEN.17.23	And Abraham tooke Ishmael his sonne, and all that were borne in his house,
b.GEN.17.24	And Abraham was ninety yeeres old and nine, when he was circumcised in the
b.GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his sonne was thirteene yeeres old, when he was circumcised in

b.GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, borne in the house, and bought with money of
b.GEN.17.3	And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,
b.GEN.17.4	As for me, behold, my couenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of
b.GEN.17.5	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall bee
b.GEN.17.6	And I will make thee exceeding fruitfull, and I will make nations of thee, and
b.GEN.17.7	And I will establish my couenant betweene me and thee, and thy seede after
b.GEN.17.8	And I will giue vnto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou
b.GEN.17.9	And God said vnto Abraham, Thou shalt keepe my couenant therefore, thou, and
b.GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament, Heauen: and the euening and the morning were the
b.GEN.18.1	And the LORD appeared vnto him, in the plaines of Mamre: and he sate in the
b.GEN.18.10	And he said, I will certainly returne vnto thee according to the time of
b.GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age: and it ceased to be
b.GEN.18.12	Therefore Sarah laughed within her selfe, saying, After I am waxed old, shall
b.GEN.18.13	And the LORD said vnto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying; Shall I of
b.GEN.18.14	Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed will I returne vnto
b.GEN.18.15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not: for she was afraid. And he said,
b.GEN.18.16	And the men rose vp from thence, and looked toward Sodome: and Abraham went
b.GEN.18.17	And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe;
b.GEN.18.18	Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all
b.GEN.18.19	For I know him, that hee will command his children, and his household after
b.GEN.18.2	And he lift vp his eyes and looked, and loe, three men stood by him: and when
b.GEN.18.20	And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodome and Gomorrah is great, and
b.GEN.18.21	I will goe downe now, and see whether they haue done altogether according to
b.GEN.18.22	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodome: but
b.GEN.18.23	And Abraham drew neere, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with
b.GEN.18.24	Peraduenture there be fifty righteous within the citie; wilt thou also
b.GEN.18.25	That be farre from thee, to do after this maner, to slay the righteous with
b.GEN.18.26	And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fiftie righteous, within the citie,
b.GEN.18.27	And Abraham answered, and said, Behold now, I haue taken vpon me to speake
b.GEN.18.28	Peraduenture there shall lacke fiue of the fiftie righteous: wilt thou
b.GEN.18.29	And hee spake vnto him yet againe, and said, Peraduenture there shall be
b.GEN.18.3	And said, My Lord, If now I haue found fauour in thy sight, passe not away, I
b.GEN.18.30	And he said vnto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speake:
b.GEN.18.31	And he said, Behold now, I haue taken vpon mee to speake vnto the Lord:
b.GEN.18.32	And hee saide, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speake yet but this
b.GEN.18.33	And the LORD went his way, assoone as hee had left communing with Abraham:
b.GEN.18.4	Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feete, and rest your
b.GEN.18.5	And I will fetch a morsell of bread; and comfort ye your hearts, after that
b.GEN.18.6	And Abraham hastened into the tent, vnto Sarah, &amp; said; Make ready quickly
b.GEN.18.7	And Abraham ranne vnto the heard, and fetcht a calfe, tender and good, and
b.GEN.18.8	And he tooke butter, and milke, and the calfe which he had dressed, and set it
b.GEN.18.9	And they said vnto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the
b.GEN.1.9	And God said, Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered together vnto one
b.GEN.19.1	And there came two Angels to Sodome at euen, and Lot sate in the gate of
b.GEN.19.10	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and
b.GEN.19.11	And they smote the men that were at the doore of the house, with blindnes,
b.GEN.19.12	And the men said vnto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? sonne in law, and thy
b.GEN.19.13	For we will destroy this place, because the crie of them is waxen great
b.GEN.19.14	And Lot went out, and spake vnto his sonnes in law, which married his
b.GEN.19.15	And when the morning arose, then the Angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take
b.GEN.19.16	And while he lingred, the men laid hold vpon his hand, and vpon the hand of
b.GEN.19.17	And it came to passe, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said,
b.GEN.19.18	And Lot said vnto them, Oh not so, my Lord.
b.GEN.19.19	Beholde now, thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
b.GEN.19.2	And he said, Beholde now my Lords, turne in, I pray you, into your seruants
b.GEN.19.20	Behold now, this citie is neere to flee vnto, and it is a litle one: Oh let
b.GEN.19.21	And he said vnto him, See, I haue accepted thee concerning this thing, that I
b.GEN.19.22	Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot doe any thing till thou bee come
b.GEN.19.23	The sunne was risen vpon the earth, when Lot entred into Zoar.
b.GEN.19.24	Then the LORD rained vpon Sodome &amp; vpon Gomorrah, brimstone and fire,
b.GEN.19.25	And he ouerthrew those cities, and all the plaine, and all the inhabitants of
b.GEN.19.26	But his wife looked backe from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
b.GEN.19.27	And Abraham gate vp earely in the morning, to the place, where hee stood
b.GEN.19.28	And he looked toward Sodome and Gomorrah, &amp; toward all the land of the
b.GEN.19.29	And it came to passe, when God destroyed the cities of the plaine, that God
b.GEN.19.30	And Lot went vp out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountaine, and his two
b.GEN.19.31	And the first borne saide vnto the yonger, Our father is old, and there is
b.GEN.19.32	Come, let vs make our father drinke wine, and we will lye with him, that we
b.GEN.19.33	And they made their father drinke wine that night, &amp; the first borne went
b.GEN.19.34	And it came to passe on the morrow, that the first borne said vnto the yonger,
b.GEN.19.35	And they made their father drinke wine that night also, and the yonger arose,
b.GEN.19.36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with childe by their father.
b.GEN.19.37	And the first borne bare a sonne, and called his name Moab: the same is the
b.GEN.19.38	And the yonger, she also bare a sonne, and called his name, Ben-ammi: the
b.GEN.19.4	But before they lay downe, the men of the citie, euen the men of Sodom,
b.GEN.19.5	And they called vnto Lot, and said vnto him, Where are the men which came in
b.GEN.19.6	And Lot went out at the doore vnto them, &amp; shut the doore after him,
b.GEN.19.7	And said, I pray you, brethren, doe not so wickedly.
b.GEN.19.8	Behold now, I haue two daughters, which haue not knowen man; let mee, I pray
b.GEN.19.9	And they said, Stand backe. And they said againe, This one fellow came in to
b.GEN.20.1	And Abraham iourneyed from thence, toward the South-Countrey, and dwelled
b.GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this
b.GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the feare of God is not in this
b.GEN.20.12	And yet indeed shee is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not
b.GEN.20.13	And it came to passe when God caused me to wander from my fathers house, that
b.GEN.20.14	And Abimelech tooke sheepe and oxen, and men-seruants, and women seruants,
b.GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee; dwel where it pleaseth
b.GEN.20.16	And vnto Sarah hee said, Behold, I haue giuen thy brother a thousand pieces
b.GEN.20.17	So Abraham prayed vnto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his
b.GEN.20.18	For the LORD had fast closed vp all the wombes of the house of Abimelech,
b.GEN.20.2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: And Abimelech King of
b.GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dreame by night, and said to him, Behold, thou
b.GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not come neere her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a
b.GEN.20.5	Said he not vnto me, She is my sister? and she, euen she herselfe said, Hee is
b.GEN.20.6	And God saide vnto him in a dreame, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the
b.GEN.20.7	Now therefore restore the man his wife: for he is a Prophet, and he shal pray
b.GEN.20.8	Therefore Abimelech rose earely in the morning, and called all his seruants,
b.GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said vnto him, What hast thou done vnto vs?
b.GEN.2.1	Thus the heauens and the earth were finished, and all the hoste of them.
b.GEN.2.10	And a riuer went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was
b.GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of
b.GEN.21.1	And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did vnto Sarah as he
b.GEN.21.10	Wherfore she said vnto Abraham, Cast out this bond woman, and her sonne: for
b.GEN.21.11	And the thing was very grieuous in Abrahams sight, because of his sonne.
b.GEN.21.12	And God said vnto Abraham, Let it not be grieuous in thy sight, because of
b.GEN.21.13	And also, of the sonne of the bond woman will I make a nation, because he is
b.GEN.21.14	And Abraham rose vp earely in the morning, and tooke bread, and a bottle of
b.GEN.21.15	And the water was spent in the bottle, and shee cast the child vnder one of
b.GEN.21.16	And she went, and sate her downe ouer against him, a good way off, as it were
b.GEN.21.17	And God heard the voice of the lad, and the Angel of God called to Hagar out
b.GEN.21.18	Arise, lift vp the lad, and hold him in thine hand: for I will make him a
b.GEN.21.19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water, and shee went, and
b.GEN.2.12	And the gold of that land is good: There is Bdellium and the Onix stone.
b.GEN.21.2	For Sarah conceiued, and bare Abraham a sonne in his old age, at the set time,
b.GEN.21.20	And God was with the lad, and he grew, and dwelt in the wildernesse, and
b.GEN.21.21	And hee dwelt in the wildernesse of Paran: and his mother tooke him a wife
b.GEN.21.22	And it came to passe at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chiefe
b.GEN.21.23	Now therefore sweare vnto mee here by God, that thou wilt not deale falsly
b.GEN.21.24	And Abraham saide, I will sweare.
b.GEN.21.25	And Abraham reproued Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelechs
b.GEN.21.26	And Abimelech saide, I wote not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou
b.GEN.21.27	And Abraham tooke sheepe and oxen, and gaue them vnto Abimelech: and both of
b.GEN.21.28	And Abraham set seuen ewe lambes of the flocke by themselues.
b.GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What meane these seuen ewe lambes, which
b.GEN.2.13	And the name of the second riuer is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the
b.GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his sonne, that was borne vnto him, whom Sarah
b.GEN.21.30	And he said, For these seuen ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they
b.GEN.21.31	Wherefore he called that place, Beer-sheba: because there they sware both of
b.GEN.21.32	Thus they made a couenant at Beeer-sheba: then Abimelech rose vp, and Phichol
b.GEN.21.33	And Abraham planted a groue in Beer-sheba, and called there on the Name of
b.GEN.21.34	And Abraham soiourned in the Philistines land, many dayes.
b.GEN.2.14	And the name of the third riuer is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward
b.GEN.21.4	And Abraham circumcised his sonne Isaac, being eight dayes old, as God had
b.GEN.2.15	And the LORD God tooke the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to
b.GEN.21.5	And Abraham was an hundred yeeres old, when his sonne Isaac was borne vnto
b.GEN.2.16	And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of euery tree of the garden thou
b.GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that heare, will laugh
b.GEN.2.17	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, thou shalt not eate of
b.GEN.21.7	And she said, Who would haue said vnto Abraham, that Sarah should haue giuen
b.GEN.2.18	And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will
b.GEN.21.8	And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast, the same
b.GEN.2.19	And out of ye ground the LORD God formed euery beast of the field, and euery
b.GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the sonne of Hagar the Egyptian, which shee had borne vnto
b.GEN.2.2	And on the seuenth day God ended his worke, which hee had made: And he rested
b.GEN.2.20	And Adam gaue names to all cattell, and to the foule of the aire, and to
b.GEN.2.21	And the LORD God caused a deepe sleepe to fall vpon Adam, and hee slept; and
b.GEN.22.1	And it came to passe after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said
b.GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched foorth his hand, and tooke the knife to slay his sonne.
b.GEN.22.11	And the Angel of the LORD called vnto him out of heauen, and said, Abraham,
b.GEN.22.12	And he said, Lay not thine hand vpon the lad, neither do thou any thing vnto
b.GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted vp his eyes, and looked, and beholde, behinde him a Ramme
b.GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of that place Iehouah-ijreh, as it is said to
b.GEN.22.15	And the Angel of the LORD called vnto Abraham out of heauen the second time,
b.GEN.22.16	And said, By my selfe haue I sworne, saith the LORD, for because thou hast
b.GEN.22.17	That in blessing I will blesse thee, and in multiplying, I will multiply thy
b.GEN.22.18	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou
b.GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned vnto his yong men, and they rose vp, and went together to
b.GEN.2.22	And the rib which the LORD God had taken from man, made hee a woman, &amp;
b.GEN.22.2	And he said, Take now thy sonne, thine onely sonne Isaac, whom thou louest,
b.GEN.22.20	And it came to passe after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying,
b.GEN.22.21	Huz his first borne, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
b.GEN.22.22	And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Iidlaph, and Bethuel.
b.GEN.22.23	And Bethuel begate Rebekah: these eight Milcah did beare to Nahor, Abrahams
b.GEN.22.24	And his concubine whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and
b.GEN.2.23	And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she

b.GEN.30.21	And afterwardes shee bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

b.GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and
b.GEN.31.17	Then Iacob rose vp, and set his sonnes and his wiues vpon camels.
b.GEN.31.18	And he caried away all his cattell, and all his goods which he had gotten,
b.GEN.31.19	And Laban went to sheare his sheepe: and Rachel had stollen the Images that

b.GEN.31.2	And Iacob behelde the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him
b.GEN.31.20	And Iacob stale away vnawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not
b.GEN.31.21	So hee fled with all that hee had, and he rose vp and passed ouer the Riuer,
b.GEN.31.22	And it was tolde Laban on the third day, that Iacob was fled.
b.GEN.31.23	And hee tooke his brethren with him, and pursued after him seuen dayes
b.GEN.31.24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dreame by night, and saide vnto him,
b.GEN.31.25	Then Laban ouertooke Iacob. Now Iacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and
b.GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Iacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stollen away
b.GEN.31.27	Wherefore didst thou flie away secretly, and steale away from me, and didst
b.GEN.31.28	And hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and my daughters? thou hast now
b.GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to doe you hurt: but the God of your father
b.GEN.3.13	And the LORD God said vnto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And
b.GEN.31.3	And the LORD said vnto Iacob, Returne vnto the land of thy fathers, and to thy
b.GEN.31.30	And now though thou wouldest needes bee gone, because thou sore longedst
b.GEN.31.31	And Iacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said,
b.GEN.31.32	With whomsoeuer thou findest thy gods, let him not liue: before our brethren
b.GEN.31.33	And Laban went into Iacobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maid
b.GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camels furniture, and
b.GEN.31.35	And shee said to her father, Let it not displease my lord, that I cannot rise
b.GEN.31.36	And Iacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Iacob answered and said to
b.GEN.31.37	Whereas thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou found of all thy
b.GEN.31.38	This twentie yeeres haue I bene with thee: thy ewes and thy shee goates haue
b.GEN.31.39	That which was torne of beasts, I brought not vnto thee: I bare the losse of

b.GEN.31.4	And Iacob sent and called Rachel and Leah, to the field vnto his flocke,
b.GEN.31.40	Thus I was in ye day, the drought consumed mee, and the frost by night, aud
b.GEN.31.41	Thus have I bene twentie yeres in thy house: I serued thee fourteene yeeres
b.GEN.31.42	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the feare of Isaac had
b.GEN.31.43	And Laban answered and said vnto Iacob, These daughters are my daughters, and
b.GEN.31.44	Now therefore come thou, let vs make a couenant, I and thou: and let it be
b.GEN.31.45	And Iacob tooke a stone, and set it vp for a pillar.
b.GEN.31.46	And Iacob saide vnto his brethren, Gather stones: and they tooke stones, and
b.GEN.31.47	And Laban called it Iegar-Sahadutha: but Iacob called it Galeed.
b.GEN.31.48	And Laban said, This heape is a witnesse betweene mee and thee this day.
b.GEN.31.49	And Mizpah: for he said, The LORD watch betweene me and thee when we are
b.GEN.3.15	And I will put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seed and
b.GEN.31.5	And said vnto them, I see your fathers countenance, that it is not toward mee
b.GEN.31.50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wiues beside
b.GEN.31.51	And Laban said to Iacob, Behold this heape, and behold this pillar, which I
b.GEN.31.52	This heape be witnesse, and this pillar be witnesse, that I will not passe
b.GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, iudge
b.GEN.31.54	Then Iacob offred sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate
b.GEN.31.55	And earely in the morning, Laban rose vp and kissed his sonnes, and his
b.GEN.3.16	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorowe and thy
b.GEN.31.6	And yee know, that with all my power I haue serued your father.
b.GEN.3.17	And vnto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened vnto the voyce of thy

b.GEN.3.18	Thornes also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee: and thou shalt eate
b.GEN.31.8	If hee said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages, then all the cattell bare
b.GEN.3.19	In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne vnto the
b.GEN.31.9	Thus God hath taken away the cattell of your father, and giuen them to mee.
b.GEN.3.2	And the woman said vnto the serpent, Wee may eate of the fruite of the trees
b.GEN.3.20	And Adam called his wiues name Eue, because she was the mother of all liuing.
b.GEN.3.21	Unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the LORD God make coates of skinnes, and
b.GEN.32.1	And Iacob went on his way, and the Angels of God met him.
b.GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the trueth, which
b.GEN.32.11	Deliuer me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau:
b.GEN.32.12	And thou saidst, I will surely doe thee good, and make thy seed as the sand
b.GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that same night, and tooke of that which came to his

b.GEN.32.16	And hee deliuered them into the hand of his seruants, euery droue by
b.GEN.32.17	And he commanded the formost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and
b.GEN.32.18	Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iacobs: it is a present sent vnto my
b.GEN.32.19	And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the
b.GEN.3.22	And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of vs, to know good
b.GEN.32.2	And when Iacob saw them, he said, This is Gods hoste: and hee called the name
b.GEN.32.20	And say ye moreouer, Beholde, thy seruant Iacob is behind vs: for he said, I
b.GEN.32.21	So went the present ouer before him: and himselfe lodged that night in the
b.GEN.32.22	And hee rose vp that night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two women
b.GEN.32.23	And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the brooke, and sent ouer that hee had.
b.GEN.32.24	And Iacob was left alone: and there wrestled a man with him, vntill the
b.GEN.32.25	And when he saw, that he preuailed not against him, he touched the hollow of
b.GEN.32.26	And he said, Let me goe, for the day breaketh: and he said, I will not let
b.GEN.32.27	And he said vnto him, what is thy name? and he said, Iacob.
b.GEN.32.28	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Iacob, but Israel: for as a
b.GEN.32.29	And Iacob asked him, and saide, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name: and he said,
b.GEN.3.23	Therefore the LORD God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden, to till the
b.GEN.32.3	And Iacob sent messengers before him, to Esau his brother, vnto the land of

b.GEN.3.24	So he droue out the man: and he placed at the East of the garden of Eden,
b.GEN.32.4	And he commaunded them, saying, Thus shall ye speake vnto my lord Esau, Thy
b.GEN.32.5	And I haue oxen, and asses, flockes, and men seruants and women seruants: and
b.GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Iacob, saying, Wee came to thy brother Esau,
b.GEN.32.7	Then Iacob was greatly afraid, and distressed, and he diuided the people that
b.GEN.32.8	And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other
b.GEN.32.9	And Iacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the
b.GEN.3.3	But of the fruit of the tree, which is in the midst of the garden, God hath
b.GEN.33.1	And Iacob lifted vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, Esau came, and with him
b.GEN.33.10	And Iacob saide, Nay, I pray thee: if now I haue found grace in thy sight,
b.GEN.33.11	Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath

b.GEN.33.13	And hee said vnto him, My lord knoweth, that the children are tender, and the
b.GEN.33.14	Let my lord, I pray thee, passe ouer before his seruant, and I will leade on
b.GEN.33.15	And Esau said, Let me now leaue with thee some of the folke that are with me:
b.GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day, on his way vnto Seir.
b.GEN.33.17	And Iacob iourneyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made boothes for
b.GEN.33.18	And Iacob came to Shalem, a citie of Shechem, which is the land of Canaan,
b.GEN.33.19	And he bought a parcell of a field where hee had spread his tent, at the hand
b.GEN.33.2	And he put the handmaides, and their chidren foremost, and Leah and her
b.GEN.33.20	And hee erected there an Altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
b.GEN.33.3	And hee passed ouer before them, and bowed himselfe to the ground seuen times,
b.GEN.33.4	And Esau ran to meete him, and imbraced him, and fell on his necke, and kissed
b.GEN.33.5	And he lift vp his eyes, and sawe the women, and the children, and said, who
b.GEN.33.6	Then the handmaidens came neere; they and their children, and they bowed
b.GEN.33.7	And Leah also with her children came neere, and bowed themselues: and after
b.GEN.33.8	And he said, What meanest thou by all this droue, which I met? And he said,
b.GEN.33.9	And Esau said, I haue enough: my brother, keepe that thou hast vnto thy selfe.
b.GEN.3.4	And the Serpent said vnto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.
b.GEN.34.1	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which shee bare vnto Iacob, went out to see
b.GEN.34.10	And ye shall dwell with vs, and the land shall be before you: dwell and trade
b.GEN.34.11	And Shechem said vnto her father, and vnto her brethren, Let mee finde grace
b.GEN.34.12	Aske mee neuer so much dowrie and gift, and I will giue according as yee
b.GEN.34.13	And the sonnes of Iacob answered Shechem, and Hamor his father deceitfully,
b.GEN.34.14	And they saide vnto them, wee cannot doe this thing, to giue our sister to
b.GEN.34.15	But in this will we consent vnto you: If ye will be as we be, that euery male
b.GEN.34.16	Then wil we giue our daughters vnto you, and we wil take your daughters to vs,
b.GEN.34.17	But if ye will not hearken vnto vs, to be circumcised, then will we take our

b.GEN.34.31	And they said, Should hee deale with our sister, as with an harlot?
b.GEN.34.4	And Shechem spake vnto his father Hamor, saying, Get mee this damsell to wife.
b.GEN.34.5	And Iacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sonnes were

b.GEN.34.7	And the sonnes of Iacob came out of the field when they heard it, and the men
b.GEN.34.8	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soule of my sonne Shechem longeth

b.GEN.35.12	And the land which I gaue Abraham, and Isaac, to thee I will giue it, and to

b.GEN.37.1	And Iacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of
b.GEN.37.10	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked
b.GEN.37.11	And his brethren enuied him: but his father obserued the saying.
b.GEN.37.12	And his brethren went to feed their fathers flocke in Shechem.
b.GEN.37.13	And Israel saide vnto Ioseph, Doe not thy brethren feed the flocke in Shechem?
b.GEN.37.14	And he said to him, Goe, I pray thee, see whether it bee well with thy
b.GEN.37.15	And a certaine man found him, and behold, hee was wandring in the field, and
b.GEN.37.16	And he said, I seeke my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feede

b.GEN.37.24	And they tooke him and cast him into a pit: and the pit was emptie, there was
b.GEN.37.25	And they sate downe to eat bread: and they lift vp their eyes and looked, and
b.GEN.37.26	And Iudah saide vnto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother,
b.GEN.37.27	Come, and let vs sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand bee vpon
b.GEN.37.28	Then there passed by Midianites merchant men, and they drew and lift vp
b.GEN.37.29	And Reuben returned vnto the pit, and behold, Ioseph was not in the pit: and
b.GEN.37.3	Now Israel loued Ioseph more then all his children, because he was the sonne

b.GEN.38.14	And shee put her widowes garments off from her, and couered her with a vaile,
b.GEN.38.15	When Iudah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot: because she had couered

b.GEN.38.20	And Iudah sent the kidde by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive
b.GEN.38.21	Then hee asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot, that was
b.GEN.38.22	And he returned to Iudah, and said, I cannot finde her: and also the men of
b.GEN.38.23	And Iudah said, Let her take it to her, lest we bee shamed: behold, I sent
b.GEN.38.24	And it came to passe about three moneths after, that it was tolde Iudah,
b.GEN.38.25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man
b.GEN.38.26	And Iudah acknowledged them, and said, She hath bin more righteous then I:
b.GEN.38.27	And it came to passe in the time of her trauaile, that beholde, twinnes were
b.GEN.38.28	And it came to passe when shee trauailed, that the one put out his hand, and

b.GEN.38.4	And shee conceiued againe, and bare a sonne, and shee called his name, Onan.
b.GEN.38.5	And she yet againe conceiued and bare a sonne, and called his name Shelah: and
b.GEN.38.6	And Iudah tooke a wife for Er his first borne, whose name was Tamar.
b.GEN.38.7	And Er, Iudahs first borne was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD
b.GEN.38.8	And Iudah said vnto Onan, Goe in vnto thy brothers wife, and marrie her, and
b.GEN.38.9	And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to passe when hee
b.GEN.3.9	And the LORD God called vnto Adam, and said vnto him, Where art thou?
b.GEN.39.1	And Ioseph was brought downe to Egypt, and Potiphar an Officer of Pharaoh,
b.GEN.39.10	And it came to passe as she spake to Ioseph day by day, that hee hearkened
b.GEN.39.11	And it came to passe about this time, that Ioseph went in to the house, to

b.GEN.39.14	That she called vnto the men of her house, and spake vnto them, saying, See,
b.GEN.39.15	And it came to passe, when hee heard that I lifted vp my voice, and cried,
b.GEN.39.16	And she laid vp his garment by her, vntill her lord came home.
b.GEN.39.17	And she spake vnto him, according to these words, saying, The Hebrew seruant

b.GEN.39.20	And Iosephs master tooke him, and put him into the prison, a place, where ye
b.GEN.39.21	But the LORD was with Ioseph, and shewed him mercie, and gaue him fauour in
b.GEN.39.22	And the keeper of the prison committed to Iosephs hand all the prisoners that
b.GEN.39.23	The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing, that was vnder his hand,
b.GEN.39.3	And his master sawe that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all
b.GEN.39.4	And Ioseph found grace in his sight, and he serued him; and hee made him

b.GEN.39.7	And it came to passe after these things, that his masters wife cast her eyes
b.GEN.39.8	But he refused, and said vnto his masters wife, Behold, my master wotteth not
b.GEN.39.9	There is none greater in this house then I: neither hath hee kept backe any

b.GEN.40.14	But thinke on me, when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindenesse, I
b.GEN.40.15	For indeed I was stollen away out of the land of the Hebrewes: and here also
b.GEN.40.16	When the chiefe Baker saw, that the interpretation was good, he said vnto
b.GEN.40.17	And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner of bake-meats for Pharaoh,
b.GEN.40.18	And Ioseph answered, and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three
b.GEN.40.19	Yet within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thy head from off thee, and
b.GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chiefe of the
b.GEN.40.20	And it came to passe the third day, which was Pharaohs birth day, that hee
b.GEN.40.21	And he restored the chiefe Butler vnto his Butlership againe, and hee gaue
b.GEN.40.22	But he hanged the chiefe Baker, as Ioseph had interpreted to them.
b.GEN.40.23	Yet did not the chiefe Butler remember Ioseph, but forgate him.
b.GEN.40.3	And he put them in ward in the house of the captaine of the guard, into the

b.GEN.40.5	And they dreamed a dreame both of them, each man his dreame in one night, each
b.GEN.40.6	And Ioseph came in vnto them in the morning, and looked vpon them, and behold,
b.GEN.40.7	And he asked Pharaohs officers that were with him in the warde of his lords
b.GEN.40.8	And they said vnto him, we haue dreamed a dreame, and there is no interpreter
b.GEN.40.9	And the chiefe Butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph, and said to him; In my

b.GEN.4.10	And he said, What hast thou done? the voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto
b.GEN.4.11	And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to
b.GEN.41.1	And it came to passe at the end of two ful yeeres, that Pharaoh dreamed: and
b.GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was wroth with his seruants, and put mee in warde, in the captaine of
b.GEN.41.11	And we dreamed a dreame in one night, I and he: we dreamed each man according
b.GEN.41.12	And there was there with vs a yong man an Hebrew, seruant to the captaine of
b.GEN.41.13	And it came to passe, as he interpreted to vs, so it was; mee he restored
b.GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Ioseph, and they brought him hastily out of the

b.GEN.41.16	And Ioseph answered Pharaoh, saying; It is not in me: God shall giue Pharaoh
b.GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph; In my dreame, behold, I stood vpon the banke of
b.GEN.41.18	And behold, there came vp out of the riuer seuen kine, fat fleshed and well
b.GEN.41.19	And behold, seuen other kine came vp after them, poore and very ill fauoured,
b.GEN.4.12	When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yeeld vnto thee her
b.GEN.41.2	And behold, there came vp out of the riuer seuen well fauoured kine, and fat
b.GEN.41.20	And the leane, &amp; the ill fauoured kine, did eate vp the first seuen fat
b.GEN.41.21	And when they had eaten them vp, it could not bee knowen that they had eaten
b.GEN.41.22	And I saw in my dreame, and behold, seuen eares came vp in one stalke, full
b.GEN.41.23	And behold, seuen eares withered, thin &amp; blasted with the East wind,
b.GEN.41.24	And the thin eares deuoured the seuen good eares: and I told this vnto the
b.GEN.41.25	And Ioseph said vnto Pharaoh, the dreame of Pharaoh is one; God hath shewed
b.GEN.41.26	The seuen good kine are seuen yeeres: and the seuen good eares are seuen
b.GEN.41.27	And the seuen thin and ill fauoured kine that came vp after them, are seuen
b.GEN.41.28	This is the thing which I haue spoken vnto Pharaoh: what God is about to doe,
b.GEN.41.29	Behold, there come seuen yeeres of great plentie, throughout all the land of
b.GEN.4.13	And Cain said vnto the LORD, My punishment is greater, then I can beare.
b.GEN.41.3	And behold, seuen other kine came vp after them out of the riuer, ill fauoured
b.GEN.41.30	And there shall arise after them, seuen yeeres of famine, and all the plentie
b.GEN.41.31	And the plentie shal not be knowen in the land, by reason of that famine
b.GEN.41.32	And for that the dreame was doubled vnto Pharaoh twice, it is because the
b.GEN.41.33	Now therfore let Pharaoh looke out a man discreet and wise, and set him ouer
b.GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh doe this, and let him appoint officers ouer the land, &amp; take
b.GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of those good yeeres that come, and lay vp
b.GEN.41.36	And that food shall be for store to the land, against the seuen yeeres of

b.GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh said vnto his seruants, Can we find such a one, as this is, a man
b.GEN.41.39	And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,
b.GEN.4.14	Behold, thou hast driuen me out this day from the face of the earth, and from
b.GEN.41.4	And the ill fauoured and leane fleshed kine, did eate vp the seuen well
b.GEN.41.40	Thou shalt be ouer my house, and according vnto thy word shall all my people

b.GEN.41.42	And Pharaoh tooke off his ring from his hand, &amp; put it vpon Iosephs hand,
b.GEN.41.43	And he made him to ride in the second charet which he had: and they cried
b.GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man
b.GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Iosephs name, Zaphnath-Paaneah, and he gaue him to wife
b.GEN.41.46	( And Ioseph was thirtie yeeres old when he stood before Pharaoh king of

b.GEN.41.48	And he gathered vp all the foode of the seuen yeeres, which were in the land
b.GEN.41.49	And Ioseph gathered corne as the sand of the sea, very much, vntill he left
b.GEN.4.15	And the LORD said vnto him, Therefore whosoeuer slayeth Cain, vengeance

b.GEN.41.50	And vnto Ioseph were borne two sonnes, before the yeeres of famine came:
b.GEN.41.51	And Ioseph called the name of the first borne Manasseh: for God, said hee,
b.GEN.41.52	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: for God hath caused mee to be
b.GEN.41.53	And the seuen yeeres of plenteousnesse, that was in the land of Egypt, were
b.GEN.41.54	And the seuen yeeres of dearth beganne to come according as Ioseph had saide,
b.GEN.41.55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for
b.GEN.41.56	And the famine was ouer all the face of the earth; and Ioseph opened all the
b.GEN.41.57	And all countreys came into Egypt to Ioseph, for to buy corne, because that

b.GEN.4.18	And vnto Enoch was borne Irad: and Irad begate Mehuiael, and Mehuiael begate

b.GEN.4.21	And his brothers name was Iubal: hee was the father of all such as handle the
b.GEN.42.1	Now when Iacob saw that there was corne in Egypt, Iacob said vnto his sonnes,
b.GEN.42.10	And they said vnto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy seruants come.
b.GEN.42.11	We are all one mans sonnes, we are true men: thy seruants are no spies.
b.GEN.42.12	And he said vnto them, Nay: but to see the nakednesse of the land, you are
b.GEN.42.13	And they said, Thy seruants are twelue brethren, the sonnes of one man in the
b.GEN.42.14	And Ioseph said vnto them, That is it that I spake vnto you, saying, Ye are
b.GEN.42.15	Hereby ye shall be proued: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not goe foorth
b.GEN.42.16	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shalbe kept in
b.GEN.42.17	And he put them all together into warde, three dayes.
b.GEN.42.18	And Ioseph said vnto them the third day, This doe, and liue: for I feare God.
b.GEN.42.19	If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your

b.GEN.42.20	But bring your yongest brother vnto mee, so shall your wordes be verified,
b.GEN.42.21	And they said one to another, We are verily guiltie concerning our brother,
b.GEN.42.22	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not vnto you, saying, Doe not sinne
b.GEN.42.23	And they knew not that Ioseph vnderstood them: for hee spake vnto them by an
b.GEN.42.24	And hee turned himselfe about from them and wept, and returned to them againe,
b.GEN.42.25	Then Ioseph commanded to fill their sackes with corne, and to restore euery
b.GEN.42.26	And they laded their asses with the corne, and departed thence.
b.GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sacke, to giue his asse prouender in the Inne,
b.GEN.42.28	And he said vnto his brethren, My money is restored, and loe, it is euen in
b.GEN.42.29	And they came vnto Iacob their father, vnto the land of Canaan, and told him
b.GEN.4.23	And Lamech sayd vnto his wiues, Adah and Zillah, Heare my voyce, yee wiues of

b.GEN.42.30	The man who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to vs, and tooke vs for
b.GEN.42.31	And we said vnto him, We are true men; we are no spies.
b.GEN.42.32	We be twelue brethren, sonnes of our father: one is not, and the yongest is
b.GEN.42.33	And the man the lord of the countrey said vnto vs, Hereby shall I know that
b.GEN.42.34	And bring your yongest brother vnto me: then shall I know that you are no
b.GEN.42.35	And it came to passe as they emptied their sacks, that behold, euery mans
b.GEN.42.36	And Iacob their father said vnto them, We haue ye bereaued of my children:
b.GEN.42.37	And Reuben spake vnto his father, saying; Slay my two sonnes, if I bring him
b.GEN.42.38	And he said, My sonne shall not goe downe with you, for his brother is dead,
b.GEN.4.24	If Cain shall bee auenged seuen fold, truely Lamech seuenty and seuen folde.
b.GEN.42.4	But Beniamin Iosephs brother, Iacob sent not with his brethren: for he said,
b.GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife againe, and she bare a sonne, &amp; called his name
b.GEN.42.5	And the sonnes of Israel came to buy corne among those that came: for the
b.GEN.4.26	And to Seth, to him also there was borne a sonne, and he called his name Enos:
b.GEN.42.6	And Ioseph was the gouernour ouer the land, and hee it was that sold to all
b.GEN.42.7	And Ioseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himselfe strange vnto
b.GEN.42.8	And Ioseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
b.GEN.42.9	And Ioseph remembred the dreames which hee dreamed of them, and said vnto
b.GEN.4.3	And in processe of time it came to passe, that Cain brought of the fruite of
b.GEN.43.1	And the famine was sore in the land.
b.GEN.43.10	For except we had lingred, surely now wee had returned this second time.
b.GEN.43.11	And their father Israel said vnto them, If it must bee so now, doe this: take
b.GEN.43.12	And take double money in your hand, and the money that was brought againe in
b.GEN.43.13	Take also your brother, and arise, goe againe vnto the man.
b.GEN.43.14	And God Almightie giue you mercie before the man, that he may send away your
b.GEN.43.15	And the men tooke that Present, and they tooke double money in their hand,
b.GEN.43.16	And when Ioseph sawe Beniamin with them, hee said to the ruler of his house,
b.GEN.43.17	And the man did as Ioseph hade: and the man brought the men into Iosephs
b.GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Iosephs house, and
b.GEN.43.19	And they came neere to the steward of Iosephs house, and they communed with
b.GEN.43.2	And it came to passe when they had eaten vp the corne, which they had brought

b.GEN.5.6	And Seth liued an hundred and fiue yeeres: and begate Enos.
b.GEN.5.7	And Seth liued, after he begate Enos, eight hundred and seuen yeeres, and
b.GEN.5.8	And all the dayes of Seth, were nine hundred and twelue yeeres, and he died.
b.GEN.5.9	And Enos liued ninetie yeeres, and begate Cainan.
b.GEN.6.1	And it came to passe, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and
b.GEN.6.10	And Noah begate three sonnes: Sem, Ham, and Iapheth.
b.GEN.6.11	The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with
b.GEN.6.12	And God looked vpon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt: for all flesh had

b.GEN.6.14	Make thee an Arke of Gopher-wood: roomes shalt thou make in the arke, and
b.GEN.6.15	And this is the fashion, which thou shalt make it of: the length of the arke
b.GEN.6.16	A window shalt thou make to the arke, and in a cubite shalt thou finish it
b.GEN.6.17	And behold, I, euen I doe bring a flood of waters vpon the earth, to destroy
b.GEN.6.18	But with thee wil I establish my Couenant: and thou shalt come into the Arke,
b.GEN.6.19	And of euery liuing thing of all flesh, two of euery sort shalt thou bring
b.GEN.6.2	That the sonnes of God saw the daughters of men, that they were faire, and
b.GEN.6.20	Of fowles after their kinde, and of cattel after their kinde: of euery
b.GEN.6.21	And take thou vnto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it
b.GEN.6.22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
b.GEN.6.3	And the LORD said, My Spirit shall not alwayes striue with man; for that hee
b.GEN.6.4	There were Giants in the earth in those daies: and also after that, when the
b.GEN.6.5	And God saw, that the wickednes of man was great in the earth, and that euery
b.GEN.6.6	And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieued him
b.GEN.6.7	And the LORD said, I will destroy man, whom I haue created, from the face of
b.GEN.6.8	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
b.GEN.6.9	These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a iust man, and perfect in his
b.GEN.7.1	And the LORD saide vnto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the Arke: for
b.GEN.7.10	And it came to passe after seuen dayes, that the waters of the Flood were
b.GEN.7.11	In the sixe hundredth yeere of Noahs life, in the second moneth, the
b.GEN.7.12	And the raine was vpon the earth, fortie dayes, and fortie nights.
b.GEN.7.13	In the selfe same day entred Noah, and Sem, and Ham, and Iapheth, the sonnes
b.GEN.7.14	They, and euery beast after his kinde, &amp; all the cattell after their
b.GEN.7.15	And they went in vnto Noah into the Arke, two and two of all flesh, wherein
b.GEN.7.16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had
b.GEN.7.17	And the Flood was fortie dayes vpon the earth, and the waters increased, and
b.GEN.7.18	And the waters preuailed, and were encreased greatly vpon the earth: and the
b.GEN.7.19	And the waters preuailed exceedingly vpon the earth, and all the high hils,
b.GEN.7.2	Of euery cleane beast thou shalt take to thee by seuens, the male and his
b.GEN.7.20	Fifteene cubits vpward, did the waters preuaile; and the mountaines were
b.GEN.7.21	And all flesh died, that mooued vpon the earth, both of fowle, &amp; of
b.GEN.7.22	All in whose nosethrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry
b.GEN.7.23	And euery liuing substance was destroyed, which was vpon the face of the

b.GEN.7.3	Of fowles also of the aire, by seuens, the male &amp; the female; to keepe
b.GEN.7.4	For yet seuen dayes, and I will cause it to raine vpon the earth, fortie dayes,
b.GEN.7.5	And Noah did according vnto all that the LORD commanded him.
b.GEN.7.6	And Noah was sixe hundred yeeres old, when the flood of waters was vpon the
b.GEN.7.7	And Noah went in, and his sonnes, and his wife, and his sonnes wiues with him,
b.GEN.7.8	Of cleane beasts, &amp; of beasts that are not cleane, &amp; of fowles, and of
b.GEN.7.9	There went in two and two vnto Noah into the Arke, the male &amp; the female,
b.GEN.8.1	And God remembred Noah, and euery liuing thing, and all the cattell that was
b.GEN.8.10	And hee stayed yet other seuen dayes; and againe hee sent foorth the doue out
b.GEN.8.11	And the doue came in to him in the euening, and loe, in her mouth was an
b.GEN.8.12	And hee stayed yet other seuen dayes, and sent forth the doue, which returned
b.GEN.8.13	And it came to passe in the sixe hundredth and one yeere, in the first moneth,
b.GEN.8.14	And in the second moneth, on the seuen and twentieth day of the moneth, was
b.GEN.8.15	And God spake vnto Noah, saying,
b.GEN.8.16	Goe foorth of the Arke, thou, and thy wife, and thy sonnes, and thy sonnes
b.GEN.8.17	Bring foorth with thee euery liuing thing that is with thee, of all flesh,
b.GEN.8.18	And Noah went foorth, and his sonnes, and his wife, and his sonnes wiues with
b.GEN.8.19	Euery beast, euery creeping thing, and euery fowle, and whatsoeuer creepeth
b.GEN.8.2	The fountaines also of the deepe, and the windowes of heauen were stopped, and
b.GEN.8.20	And Noah builded an Altar vnto the LORD, and tooke of euery cleane beast, and
b.GEN.8.21	And the LORD smelled a sweete sauour, and the LORD said in his heart, I will
b.GEN.8.22	While the earth remaineth, seed-time and haruest, and cold, and heat, and
b.GEN.8.3	And the waters returned from off the earth, continually: and after the end of
b.GEN.8.4	And the Arke rested in the seuenth moneth, on the seuenteenth day of the
b.GEN.8.5	And the waters decreased continually vntill the tenth moneth: in the tenth
b.GEN.8.6	And it came to passe at the end of forty dayes, that Noah opened the window of
b.GEN.8.7	And he sent forth a Rauen, which went foorth to and fro, vntill the waters
b.GEN.8.8	Also hee sent foorth a doue from him, to see if the waters were abated from
b.GEN.8.9	But the doue found no rest for the sole of her foote, and she returned vnto
b.GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah, and his sonnes, and said vnto them, Bee fruitfull and
b.GEN.9.10	And with euery liuing creature that is with you, of the fowle, of the cattell,
b.GEN.9.11	And I wil establish my couenant with you, neither shal all flesh be cut off
b.GEN.9.12	And God said, This is the token of the Couenant which I make betweene mee and
b.GEN.9.13	I doe set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a couenant,
b.GEN.9.14	And it shall come to passe, when I bring a cloud ouer the earth, that the bow

b.GEN.9.18	And the sonnes of Noah that went forth of the Arke, were Shem, and Ham, and
b.GEN.9.19	These are the three sonnes of Noah: and of them was the whole earth

b.GEN.9.23	And Shem and Iaphet tooke a garment, and layed it vpon both their shoulders,
b.GEN.9.24	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonger sonne had done vnto
b.GEN.9.25	And he said, Cursed bee Canaan: a seruant of seruants shall hee be vnto his
b.GEN.9.26	And hee saide, Blessed bee the LORD God of Shem, and Canaan shalbe his
b.GEN.9.27	God shall enlarge Iaphet, and he shal dwel in the tents of Shem, and Canaan
b.GEN.9.28	And Noah liued after the flood, three hundred and fifty yeeres.
b.GEN.9.29	And all the dayes of Noah were nine hundred &amp; fifty yeeres, and he died.
b.GEN.9.3	Euery mouing thing that liueth, shalbe meat for you; euen as the greene herbe
b.GEN.9.4	But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not

b.GEN.9.6	Who so sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image
b.GEN.9.7	And you, be ye fruitfull, and multiply, bring foorth aboundantly in the earth,
b.GEN.9.8	And God spake vnto Noah, and to his sonnes with him, saying;
b.GEN.9.9	And I, behold, I establish my couenant with you, and with your seede after
b.HAB.1.1	The burden which Habakkuk ye Prophet did see.

b.HAG.2.14	Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation
b.HAG.2.15	And now I pray you consider from this day and vpward, from before a stone was
b.HAG.2.16	Since those dayes were, when one came to an heape of twentie measures, there
b.HAG.2.17	I smote you with blasting, and with mildew, and with haile in all the labours
b.HAG.2.18	Consider now from this day, and vpward from the foure and twentieth day of
b.HAG.2.19	Is the seed yet in the barne? yea, as yet the vine and the fig tree, &amp;
b.HAG.2.2	Speake now to Zerubbabel the sonne of Shealtiel, gouernour of Iudah, and to

b.HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord, and bee strong, O Ioshua,
b.HAG.2.5	According to the word that I couenanted with you, when ye came out of Egypt,

b.HAG.2.9	The glory of this latter house shal be greater then of the former, saith the

b.HEB.10.10	By the which will wee are sanctified, through the offering of the body of
b.HEB.10.11	And euery Priest standeth dayly ministring and offering oftentimes the same
b.HEB.10.12	But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes for euer, sate
b.HEB.10.13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstoole.
b.HEB.10.14	For by one offering hee hath perfected for euer them that are sanctified.
b.HEB.10.15	Whereof the holy Ghost also is a witnesse to vs: for after that he had said
b.HEB.10.16	This is the Couenant that I wil make with them after those dayes, saith the
b.HEB.10.17	And their sinnes and iniquities will I remember no more.
b.HEB.10.18	Now, where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sinne.
b.HEB.10.19	Hauing therefore, brethren, boldnesse to enter into the Holiest by the blood
b.HEB.10.2	For then would they not haue ceased to be offered, because that the
b.HEB.10.20	By a new and liuing way which hee hath consecrated for vs, through the vaile,
b.HEB.10.21	And hauing an high Priest ouer the house of God:
b.HEB.10.22	Let vs drawe neere with a true heart in full assurance of faith, hauing our
b.HEB.10.23	Let vs hold fast the profession of our faith without wauering (for he is
b.HEB.10.24	And let vs consider one another to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes:
b.HEB.10.25	Not forsaking the assembling of our selues together, as the manner of some
b.HEB.10.26	For if we sinne wilfully after that we haue receiued the knowledge of the
b.HEB.10.27	But a certaine fearefull looking for of iudgement, and fiery indignation,
b.HEB.10.28	Hee that despised Moses Lawe, died without mercy, vnder two or three
b.HEB.10.29	Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye, shall hee be thought worthy, who
b.HEB.10.3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance againe made of sinnes euery
b.HEB.10.30	For we know him that hath said, Uengeance belongeth vnto me, I wil recompence,
b.HEB.10.31	It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God.
b.HEB.10.32	But call to remembrance the former dayes, in which after yee were
b.HEB.10.33	Partly whilest ye were made a gazing stocke both by reproches &amp;
b.HEB.10.34	For yee had compassion of me in my bonds, and tooke ioyfully the spoyling of
b.HEB.10.35	Cast not away therfore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward.
b.HEB.10.36	For ye haue need of patience, that shall after ye haue done the will of God
b.HEB.10.37	For yet a litle while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tary.
b.HEB.10.38	Now the iust shall liue by faith: but if any man drawe backe, my soule shall
b.HEB.10.39	But wee are not of them who draw backe vnto perdition: but of them that
b.HEB.10.4	For it is not possible that the blood of Bulles and of Goats, should take away
b.HEB.10.5	Wherefore when hee commeth into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering
b.HEB.10.6	In burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sinne thou hast had no pleasure:
b.HEB.10.7	Then said I, Loe, I come. (In the volume of the booke it is written of me) to
b.HEB.10.8	Aboue when hee said, Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt offerings, and
b.HEB.10.9	Then said he, Loe, I come to doe thy will (O God:) He taketh away the first,
b.HEB.1.1	God who at sundry times, and in diuers manners, spake in time past vnto the
b.HEB.1.10	And, thou Lord in the beginning hast layed the foundation of the earth: and
b.HEB.1.11	They shall perish, but thou remainest: and they all shal waxe old as doth a
b.HEB.11.1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the euidence of things not

b.HEB.11.11	Through faith also Sara her selfe receiued strength to conceiue seede, and
b.HEB.11.12	Therfore sprang there euen of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the
b.HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, not hauing receiued the promises, but hauing seene
b.HEB.11.14	For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seeke a countrey.
b.HEB.11.15	And truly if they had been mindfull of that countrey, from whence they came
b.HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better countrey, that is, an heauenly: wherefore God is
b.HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered vp Isaac: and he that had

b.HEB.1.12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them vp, and they shall be changed, but thou

b.HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Iacob and Esau concerning things to come.
b.HEB.11.21	By faith Iacob when hee was a dying, blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph, and
b.HEB.11.22	By faith, Ioseph when hee died, made mention of the departing of the children
b.HEB.11.23	By faith; Moses when hee was borne was hid three moneths of his parents,
b.HEB.11.24	By faith Moses when hee was come to yeeres, refused to bee called the sonne
b.HEB.11.25	Chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enioy the
b.HEB.11.26	Esteeming the reproch of Christ greater riches then the treasures in Egypt:
b.HEB.11.27	By faith hee forsooke
b.HEB.11.28	Through faith he kept the Passeouer, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he

b.HEB.11.3	Through faith we vnderstand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so
b.HEB.11.30	By faith the walles of Iericho fell downe, after they were compassed about
b.HEB.11.31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that beleeued not, when shee

b.HEB.11.33	Who through faith subdued kingdomes, wrought righteousnesse, obteined
b.HEB.11.34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of
b.HEB.11.35	Women receiued their dead raised to life againe: and others were tortured,
b.HEB.11.36	And others had triall of cruell mockings and scourgings, yea moreouer, of
b.HEB.11.37	They were stoned, they were sawen asunder, were tempted, were slaine with the
b.HEB.11.38	Of whome the world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and in

b.HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered vnto God a more excellent sacrifice then Kain, by which
b.HEB.11.40	God hauing prouided some better thing for vs, that they without vs, should
b.HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was not
b.HEB.11.6	But without faith it is impossible to please him: for hee that commeth to God,
b.HEB.11.7	By faith Noah being warned of God of things not seene as yet, moued with feare,
b.HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham when he was called to goe out into a place which hee should
b.HEB.11.9	By faith hee soiourned in the land of promise, as in a strange countrey,
b.HEB.1.2	Hath in these last dayes spoken vnto vs by his Sonne, whom he hath appointed
b.HEB.12.1	Wherefore, seeing wee also are compassed about with so great a cloude of
b.HEB.12.10	For they verily for a fewe dayes chastened vs after their owne pleasure, but
b.HEB.12.11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous:
b.HEB.12.12	Wherefore lift vp the handes which hang downe, and the feeble knees.
b.HEB.12.13	And make straight paths for your feete, lest that which is lame bee turned
b.HEB.12.14	Followe peace with all men, and holinesse, without which no man shall see the
b.HEB.12.15	Looking diligently, lest any man faile of the grace of God, lest any roote of
b.HEB.12.16	Lest there bee any fornicatour, or profane person, as Esau, who for one
b.HEB.12.17	For yee know how that afterward when hee would haue inherited the blessing,
b.HEB.12.18	For yee are not come vnto the mount that might be touched, and that burned
b.HEB.12.19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voyce of wordes, which voyce they that
b.HEB.12.2	Looking vnto Iesus the Authour and finisher of our faith, who for the ioy that
b.HEB.12.20	For they could not indure that which was commaunded: And if so much as a
b.HEB.12.21	And so terrible was the sight, that Moses sayde, I exceedingly feare, and
b.HEB.12.22	But ye are come vnto mount Sion, and vnto the citie of the liuing God the
b.HEB.12.23	To the generall assembly, and Church of the first borne which are written in
b.HEB.12.24	And to Iesus the mediatour of the new Couenant, and to the blood of
b.HEB.12.25	See that yee refuse not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not who
b.HEB.12.26	Whose voice then shooke the earth, but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once
b.HEB.12.27	And this word Yet once more, signifieth the remouing of those things that are
b.HEB.12.28	Wherefore wee receiuing a kingdome which cannot bee moued, let vs haue grace,
b.HEB.12.29	For our God is a consuming fire.
b.HEB.12.3	For consider him that indured such contradiction of sinners against himselfe,
b.HEB.12.4	Yee haue not yet resisted vnto blood, striuing against sinne.
b.HEB.12.5	And ye haue forgotten the exhortation which speaketh vnto you as vnto
b.HEB.12.6	For whome the Lord loueth hee chasteneth, and scourgeth euery sonne whom he
b.HEB.12.7	If yee endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sonnes: for what sonne
b.HEB.12.8	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye
b.HEB.12.9	Furthermore, wee haue had fathers of our flesh, which corrected vs, and we
b.HEB.1.3	Who being the brightnesse of his glory, and the expresse image of his person,
b.HEB.13.1	Let brotherly loue continue.
b.HEB.13.10	Wee haue an altar whereof they haue no right to eate, which serue the
b.HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the Sanctuary by
b.HEB.13.12	Wherefore Iesus also, that hee might sanctifie the people with his own blood,
b.HEB.13.13	Let vs goe foorth therefore vnto him without the campe, bearing his reproch.
b.HEB.13.14	For here haue we no continuing citie, but we seeke one to come.
b.HEB.13.15	By him therefore let vs offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,
b.HEB.13.16	But to doe good, and to communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God
b.HEB.13.17	Obey them that haue the rule ouer you, and submit your selues: for they watch
b.HEB.13.18	Pray for vs: for we trust wee haue a good conscience in all things, willing
b.HEB.13.19	But I beseech you the rather to doe this, that I may be restored to you the
b.HEB.13.2	Bee not forgetfull to entertaine strangers, for thereby some haue entertayned
b.HEB.13.20	Now the God of peace, that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus, that
b.HEB.13.21	Make you perfect in euery good worke to doe his will, working in you that
b.HEB.13.22	And I beseech you brethren, suffer the word of exhortation, for I haue
b.HEB.13.23	Know yee, that our brother Timothie is set at libertie, with whom if he come
b.HEB.13.24	Salute all them that haue the rule ouer you, and al the Saints. They of
b.HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all. Amen.
b.HEB.13.3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer
b.HEB.13.4	Mariage is honorable in all, and the bed vndefiled: but whoremongers, and
b.HEB.13.5	Let your conuersation bee without couetousnesse: and be content with such
b.HEB.13.6	So that wee may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not feare what
b.HEB.13.7	Remember them which haue the rule ouer you, who haue spoken vnto you the word
b.HEB.13.8	Iesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for euer.
b.HEB.13.9	Be not caried about with diuers and strange doctrines: for it is a good thing
b.HEB.1.4	Being made so much better then the Angels, as hee hath by inheritance obtained
b.HEB.1.5	For vnto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my sonne, this day
b.HEB.1.6	And againe, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, hee saith,
b.HEB.1.7	And of the Angels he saith: Who maketh his Angels spirits, and his ministers a
b.HEB.1.8	But vnto the Sonne, he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for euer and euer: a
b.HEB.1.9	Thou hast loued righteousnesse, and hated iniquitie, therefore God, euen thy
b.HEB.2.1	Therefore we ought to giue the more earnest heede to the things which we haue
b.HEB.2.10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in
b.HEB.2.11	For both hee that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one:
b.HEB.2.12	Saying, I will declare thy Name vnto my brethren, in the midst of the Church
b.HEB.2.13	And againe, I will put my trust in him: and againe, Behold, I, and the
b.HEB.2.14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also
b.HEB.2.15	And deliuer them, who through feare of death were all their life time subiect
b.HEB.2.16	For verely he tooke not on him the nature of Angels: but he tooke on him the
b.HEB.2.17	Wherfore in all things it behooued him to bee made like vnto his brethren,
b.HEB.2.18	For in that he himselfe hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour
b.HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and euery transgression and
b.HEB.2.3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great saluation, which at the first
b.HEB.2.4	God also bearing them witnesse, both with signes &amp; wonders, and with
b.HEB.2.5	For vnto the Angels hath he not put in subiection the world to come, whereof
b.HEB.2.6	But one in a certaine place testified, saying: What is man, that thou art
b.HEB.2.7	Thou madest him a little lower then the Angels, thou crownedst him with glory
b.HEB.2.8	Thou hast put all things in subiection vnder his feete. For in that he put all
b.HEB.2.9	But wee see Iesus, who was made a little lower then the Angels, for the
b.HEB.3.1	Wherfore holy brethre, partakers of the heauenly calling, consider the Apostle
b.HEB.3.10	Wherefore I was grieued with that generation, and sayd, They doe alway erre
b.HEB.3.11	So I sware in my wrath: they shall not enter into my rest.
b.HEB.3.12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe,
b.HEB.3.13	But exhort one another dayly, while it is called To day, least any of you be
b.HEB.3.14	For wee are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
b.HEB.3.15	Whilest it is sayd, To day if yee will heare his voice, harden not your
b.HEB.3.16	For some when they had heard, did prouoke: howbeit not all that came out of
b.HEB.3.17	But with whom was he grieued fourty yeeres? was it not with them that had
b.HEB.3.18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them
b.HEB.3.19	So we see that they could not enter in, because of vnbeleefe.
b.HEB.3.2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithfull in all
b.HEB.3.3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses, in as much as he who
b.HEB.3.4	For euery house is builded by some man, but hee that built all things is God.
b.HEB.3.5	And Moses verely was faithfull in all his house as a seruant, for a testimonie
b.HEB.3.6	But Christ as a Sonne ouer his owne house, whose house are wee, if we hold
b.HEB.3.7	Wherfore as the holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will heare his voyce,
b.HEB.3.8	Harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation, in the day of temptation in the
b.HEB.3.9	When your fathers tempted me, prooued me, and saw my works fourty yeeres.
b.HEB.4.1	Let vs therefore feare, lest a promise being left vs, of entring into his
b.HEB.4.10	For he that is entred into his rest, hee also hath ceased from his owne
b.HEB.4.11	Let vs labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the
b.HEB.4.12	For the word of God is quicke and powerfull, and sharper then any two edged
b.HEB.4.13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all
b.HEB.4.14	Seeing then that wee haue a great high Priest, that is passed into the
b.HEB.4.15	For wee haue not an high Priest which cannot bee touched with the feeling of
b.HEB.4.16	Let vs therefore come boldly vnto the throne of grace, that wee may obtaine
b.HEB.4.2	For vnto vs was the Gospel preached, as well as vnto the: but the word
b.HEB.4.3	For we which haue beleeued do enter into rest, as hee said, As I haue sworne
b.HEB.4.4	For he spake in a certaine place of the seuenth day on this wise: And God did
b.HEB.4.5	And in this place againe: If they shall enter into my rest.
b.HEB.4.6	Seeing therfore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it
b.HEB.4.7	Againe, hee limiteth a certaine day, saying in Dauid, To day, after so long a
b.HEB.4.8	For if Iesus had giuen them rest, then would he not afterward haue spoken of
b.HEB.4.9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
b.HEB.5.1	For euery high Priest taken from among men, is ordeined for men in things
b.HEB.5.10	Called of God an high Priest after the order of Melchisedec:
b.HEB.5.11	Of whom we haue many things to say, and hard to be vttered, seeing ye are
b.HEB.5.12	For when for the time yee ought to bee teachers, yee haue neede that one
b.HEB.5.13	For euery one that vseth milke, is vnskilful in the word of righteousnes: for
b.HEB.5.14	But strong meate belongeth to them that are of full age, euen those who by
b.HEB.5.2	Who can haue compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way,
b.HEB.5.3	And by reason heereof hee ought as for the people, so also for himselfe, to
b.HEB.5.4	And no man taketh this honour vnto himselfe, but hee that is called of God, as
b.HEB.5.5	So also, Christ glorified not himselfe, to bee made an High Priest: but hee
b.HEB.5.6	As he saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest for euer after the order
b.HEB.5.7	Who in the dayes of his flesh, when hee had offered vp prayers and
b.HEB.5.8	Though hee were a Sonne, yet learned hee obedience, by the things which he
b.HEB.5.9	And being made perfect, he became the authour of eternall saluation vnto all
b.HEB.6.1	Therefore leauing the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let vs goe on vnto
b.HEB.6.10	For God is not vnrighteous, to forget your worke and labour of loue, which
b.HEB.6.11	And wee desire, that euery one of you doe shewe the same diligence, to the
b.HEB.6.12	That yee be not slothfull, but followers of them, who through faith and
b.HEB.6.13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because hee could sweare by no greater,
b.HEB.6.14	Saying, Surely, blessing I will blesse thee, and multiplying I wil multiply
b.HEB.6.15	And so after he had patiently indured, he obtained the promise.
b.HEB.6.16	For men verily sweare by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them
b.HEB.6.17	Wherein God willing more abundantly to shewe vnto the heyres of promise the
b.HEB.6.18	That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lye, wee
b.HEB.6.19	Which hope we haue as an anker of the soule both sure and stedfast, and which
b.HEB.6.2	Of the doctrine of Baptismes, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection
b.HEB.6.20	Whither the forerunner is for vs entrrd; euen Iesus, made an high Priest for
b.HEB.6.3	And this will we doe, if God permit.
b.HEB.6.4	For it is impossible for those who were once inlightned, and haue tasted of
b.HEB.6.5	And haue tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come;
b.HEB.6.6	If they shall fall away, to renue them againe vnto repentance: seeing they
b.HEB.6.7	For the earth which drinketh in the raine that commeth oft vpon it, and
b.HEB.6.8	But that which beareth thornes and briers, is reiected, and is nigh vnto
b.HEB.6.9	But beloued, wee are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany
b.HEB.7.1	For this Melchisedec king of Salem, Priest of the most high God, who met
b.HEB.7.10	For hee was yet in the loynes of his Father when Melchisedec met him.
b.HEB.7.11	If therefore perfection were by the Leuiticall Priesthood (for vnder it the
b.HEB.7.12	For the Priesthood being chaunged, there is made of necessitie a change also
b.HEB.7.13	For hee of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of
b.HEB.7.14	For it is euident that our Lorde sprang out of Iuda, of which tribe Moses
b.HEB.7.15	And it is yet farre more euident: for that after the similitude of
b.HEB.7.16	Who is made not after the Law of a carnall commandement, but after the power
b.HEB.7.17	For hee testifieth; Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of
b.HEB.7.18	For there is verily a disanulling of the commandement going before, for the
b.HEB.7.19	For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did:
b.HEB.7.2	To whom also Abraham gaue a tenth part of all: first being by interpretation
b.HEB.7.20	And in as much as not without an othe he was made Priest,
b.HEB.7.21	(For those Priests were made without an oath: but this with an oath, by him
b.HEB.7.22	By so much was Iesus made a suertie of a better Testament.
b.HEB.7.23	And they truely were many Priests, because they were not suffered to continue
b.HEB.7.24	But this man because hee continueth euer, hath an vnchangeable Priesthood.
b.HEB.7.25	Wherefore he is able also to saue them to the vttermost, that come vnto God
b.HEB.7.26	For such an high Priest became vs, who is holy, harmelesse, vndefiled,
b.HEB.7.27	Who needeth not daily, as those high Priests, to offer vp sacrifice, first
b.HEB.7.28	For the Law maketh men high Priests which haue infirmitie, but the word of
b.HEB.7.3	Without father, without mother, without descent, hauing neither beginning of
b.HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man was, vnto who euen the patriarch Abraham gaue
b.HEB.7.5	And verily they that are of the sonnes of Leui, who receiue the office of the
b.HEB.7.6	But he whose descent is not counted from them, receiued tithes of Abraham, and
b.HEB.7.7	And without all contradiction, the lesse is blessed of the better.
b.HEB.7.8	And here men that die receiue tithes: but there hee receiueth them, of whom it
b.HEB.7.9	And as I may so say, Leui also who receiueth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
b.HEB.8.1	Now of the things which we haue spoken, this is the summe: wee haue such an
b.HEB.8.10	For this is the Couenant that I will make with the house of
b.HEB.8.11	And they shall not teach euery man his neighbour, and euery man his brother,
b.HEB.8.12	For I will be mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and their sins &amp; their
b.HEB.8.13	In that he saith, A new Couenant, he hath made the first olde. Now that which
b.HEB.8.2	A minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord
b.HEB.8.3	For euery high Priest is ordeined to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it
b.HEB.8.4	For if he were on earth, he should not bee a Priest, seeing that there are
b.HEB.8.5	Who serue vnto the example and shadow of heauenly things, as Moses was
b.HEB.8.6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministerie, by how much also he is
b.HEB.8.7	For if that first Couenant had bene faultles, then should no place haue bene
b.HEB.8.8	For finding fault with them, hee saith, Behold, the dayes come (saith the
b.HEB.8.9	Not according to the Couenant that I made with their fathers, in the day when
b.HEB.9.1	Then verily the first Couenant had also ordinances of diuine Seruice, and a
b.HEB.9.10	Which stood onely in meates and drinkes, and diuers washings, and carnall
b.HEB.9.11	But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come, by a greater and
b.HEB.9.12	Neither by the blood of Goats and Calues: but by his owne blood hee entred in
b.HEB.9.13	For if the blood of Bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
b.HEB.9.14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit,
b.HEB.9.15	And for this cause hee is the Mediatour of the New Testament, that by meanes
b.HEB.9.16	For where a Testament is, there must also of necessitie bee the death of the
b.HEB.9.17	For a Testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no
b.HEB.9.18	Whereupon, neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood.
b.HEB.9.19	For when Moses had spoken euery precept to all the people according to the
b.HEB.9.2	For there was a Tabernacle made, the first, wherein was the Candlesticke, and
b.HEB.9.20	Saying, This is the blood of the Testament which God hath enioyned vnto you.
b.HEB.9.21	Moreouer, hee sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle, and all the vessels
b.HEB.9.22	And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood: and without shedding
b.HEB.9.23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heauens should
b.HEB.9.24	For Christ is not entred into the Holy places made with handes, which are the
b.HEB.9.25	Nor yet that he should offer himselfe often, as the high Priest entreth into
b.HEB.9.26	For then must hee often haue suffered since the foundation of the world: but
b.HEB.9.27	And as it is appointed vnto men once to die, but after this the Iudgement:
b.HEB.9.3	And after the second vaile, the Tabernacle which is called ye Holiest of all:
b.HEB.9.4	Which had the golden Censor, and the Arke of the Couenant ouerlayed round
b.HEB.9.5	And ouer it the Cherubims of glory shadowing the Mercyseat; of which we cannot
b.HEB.9.6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the Priestes went alwayes into the
b.HEB.9.7	But into the second went the high Priest alone once euery yeere, not without
b.HEB.9.8	The holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the Holiest of all, was not
b.HEB.9.9	Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offred both gifts
b.HOS.10.1	Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruite vnto himselfe: according to
b.HOS.10.10	It is in my desire that I should chastise them, and the people shall be
b.HOS.10.11	And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loueth to tread out the corne,
b.HOS.10.12	Sow to your selues in righteousnesse, reape in mercie: breake vp your fallow
b.HOS.10.13	Ye haue plowed wickednesse, yee haue reaped iniquitie, ye haue eaten the
b.HOS.10.14	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall
b.HOS.10.15	So shall Bethel doe vnto you, because of your great wickednesse: in a morning
b.HOS.10.2	Their heart is diuided: now shall they be found faultie: hee shall breake
b.HOS.10.3	For now they shall say, We haue no King, because we feared not the Lord, What
b.HOS.10.4	They haue spoken words, swearing falsely in making a couenant: thus iudgement
b.HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall feare, because of the calues of Bethauen: for
b.HOS.10.6	It shall be also caried vnto Assyria for a present to King Iareb: Ephraim
b.HOS.10.7	As for Samaria, her King is cut off as the fome vpon the water.
b.HOS.10.8	The high places also of Auen, the sinne of Israel, shall be destroyed: the
b.HOS.10.9	O Israel, thou hast sinned from the dayes of Gibeah: there they stood: the
b.HOS.1.1	The word of the Lord that came vnto Hosea, the sonne of Beeri, in the dayes of
b.HOS.1.10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea,
b.HOS.1.11	Then shall the children of Iudah and the children of Israel be gathered
b.HOS.11.1	When Israel was a childe, then I loued him, and called my sonne out of Egypt.
b.HOS.11.10	They shal walke after the Lord: he shall roare like a lyon: when he shall
b.HOS.11.11	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a doue out of the land of
b.HOS.11.12	Ephraim compasseth mee about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit:
b.HOS.11.2	As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed vnto Baalim, and
b.HOS.11.3	I taught Ephraim also to goe, taking them by their armes: but they knew not
b.HOS.11.4	I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of loue, and I was to them as they
b.HOS.11.5	He shall not returne into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be his
b.HOS.11.6	And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and
b.HOS.11.7	And my people are bent to backesliding from mee: though they called them to
b.HOS.11.8	How shall I giue thee vp, Ephraim? how shall I deliuer thee, Israel? how shall
b.HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fiercenes of mine anger, I will not returne to destroy
b.HOS.1.2	The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea: and the Lord sayd to Hosea,
b.HOS.12.1	Ephraim feedeth on winde, and followeth after the East winde: hee daily
b.HOS.12.10	I haue also spoken by the prophets, and I haue multiplied visions, and vsed
b.HOS.12.11	Is there iniquitie in Gilead? surely they are vanitie, they sacrifice
b.HOS.12.12	And Iacob fled into the countrey of Syria, and Israel serued for a wife, and
b.HOS.12.13	And by a Prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a Prophet was
b.HOS.12.14	Ephraim prouoked him to anger, most bitterly: therefore shall he leaue his
b.HOS.12.2	The Lord hath also a controuersie with Iudah, and will punish Iacob according
b.HOS.12.3	Hee tooke his brother by the heele in the wombe, and by his strength he had
b.HOS.12.4	Yea, he had power ouer the Angel and preuailed: hee wept and made supplication
b.HOS.12.5	Euen the Lord God of hosts, the Lord is his memoriall.
b.HOS.12.6	Therefore turne thou to thy God: keepe mercie and iudgement, and wait on thy
b.HOS.12.7	He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: hee loueth to
b.HOS.12.8	And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I haue found mee out substance: in all
b.HOS.12.9	And I that am the Lord thy God from the lande of Egypt, will yet make thee to
b.HOS.1.3	So he went and tooke Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, which conceiued and bare
b.HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spake, trembling, he exalted himselfe in Israel, but, when he
b.HOS.13.10	I will be thy King: where is any other that may saue thee in all thy cities?
b.HOS.13.11	I gaue thee a king in mine anger, and tooke him away in my wrath.
b.HOS.13.12	The iniquitie of Ephraim is bound vp: his sinne is hid.
b.HOS.13.13	The sorrowes of a traueiling woman shall come vpon him, he is an vnwise sonne,
b.HOS.13.14	I will ransome them from the power of the graue: I will redeeme them from

b.HOS.13.4	Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God,
b.HOS.13.5	I did know thee in the wildernesse, in the land of great drought.
b.HOS.13.6	According to their pasture, so were they filled: they were filled, and their

b.HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lacke of knowledge: because thou hast reiected
b.HOS.4.7	As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therfore wil I change their

b.HOS.6.5	Therefore haue I shewed them by the Prophets: I haue slaine them by the wordes
b.HOS.6.6	For I desired mercie, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more then

b.HOS.7.16	They returne, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitfull bow: their
b.HOS.7.2	And they consider not in their hearts that I remember al their wickednesse:
b.HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickednesse, and the princes with their
b.HOS.7.4	They are al adulterers, as an ouen heated by the baker: who ceaseth from
b.HOS.7.5	In the day of our King, the princes haue made him sicke with bottels of wine,
b.HOS.7.6	For they haue made ready their heart like an ouen, whiles they lie in wait:

b.HOS.8.11	Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sinne, altars shall be vnto him to

b.HOS.8.3	Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemie shall pursue him.
b.HOS.8.4	They haue set vp Kings, but not by me: they haue made Princes, and I knew it
b.HOS.8.5	Thy calfe, O Samaria, hath cast thee off: mine anger is kindled against them:
b.HOS.8.6	For from Israel was it also, the workeman made it, therefore it is not God:
b.HOS.8.7	For they haue sowen the winde, and they shall reape the whirlewinde: it hath
b.HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed vp, now shal they be among the Gentiles, as a vessell
b.HOS.8.9	For they are gone vp to Assyria, a wilde Asse alone by himselfe; Ephraim hath

b.HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wildernesse: I saw your fathers as the

b.HOS.9.14	Giue them, O Lord: what wilt thou giue? giue them a miscarying wombe, and
b.HOS.9.15	All their wickednesse is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the
b.HOS.9.16	Ephraim is smitten, their roote is dried vp, they shall beare no fruite: yea
b.HOS.9.17	My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken vnto him: and they

b.ISA.12.2	Behold, God is my saluation: I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord
b.ISA.1.23	Thy princes are rebellious and companions of theeues: euery one loueth gifts,
b.ISA.12.3	Therefore with ioy shall yee draw water out of the wels of saluation.

b.ISA.1.27	Zion shall be redeemed with iudgement, and her conuerts with righteousnesse.
b.ISA.1.28	And the destruction of the transgressours and of the sinners shall be

b.ISA.13.16	Their children also shalbe dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses
b.ISA.13.17	Beholde, I will stirre vp the Medes against them, which shall not regard
b.ISA.13.18	Their bowes also shall dash the yong men to pieces, and they shall haue no

b.ISA.13.7	Therefore shall all hands bee faint, and euery mans heart shall melt.
b.ISA.13.8	And they shalbe afraid: pangs and sorrowes shall take hold of them, they
b.ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the Lord commeth, cruell both with wrath and fierce anger,
b.ISA.1.4	Ah sinnefull nation, a people laden with iniquitie, a seede of euill doers,
b.ISA.14.1	For the Lord wil haue mercie on Iacob, and wil yet choose Israel, and set them
b.ISA.14.10	All they shall speake and say vnto thee; Art thou also become weake as we?
b.ISA.14.11	Thy pompe is brought downe to the graue, and the noyse of thy violes: the
b.ISA.14.12	How art thou fallen from heauen, O Lucifer, sonne of the morning? how art
b.ISA.14.13	For thou hast said in thine heart; I wil ascend into heauen, I wil exalt my
b.ISA.14.14	I wil ascend aboue the heights of the cloudes, I wil bee like the most High.
b.ISA.14.15	Yet thou shalt be brought downe to hel, to the sides of the pit.
b.ISA.14.16	They that see thee shal narrowly looke vpon thee, and consider thee, saying;
b.ISA.14.17	That made the world as a wildernesse, and destroyed the cities thereof that
b.ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations, euen all of them lie in glory, euery one in his

b.ISA.14.20	Thou shalt not be ioyned with them in buriall, because thou hast destroyed
b.ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquitie of their fathers, that
b.ISA.14.22	For I will rise vp against them, sayth the Lord of hostes, and cut off from
b.ISA.14.23	I will also make it a possession for the Bitterne, and pooles of water: and I
b.ISA.14.24	The Lord of hostes hath sworne, saying; Surely as I haue thought, so shall it
b.ISA.14.25	That I will breake the Assyrian in my land, and vpon my mountaines tread him
b.ISA.14.26	This is the purpose, that is purposed vpon the whole earth: and this is the
b.ISA.14.27	For the Lord of hostes hath purposed, and who shall disanull it? and his hand
b.ISA.14.28	In the yeere that king Ahaz died, was this burden.
b.ISA.14.29	Reioyce not thou whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is
b.ISA.14.3	And it shall come to passe in the day that the Lord shal giue thee rest from
b.ISA.14.30	And the first borne of the poore shall feed, and the needy shall lie downe in
b.ISA.14.31	Howle, O gate, crie, O citie, thou whole Palestina art dissolued, for there
b.ISA.14.32	What shall one then answere the messengers of the nation? that the Lord hath
b.ISA.14.4	That thou shalt take vp this prouerbe against the king of Babylon, and say;
b.ISA.14.5	The Lord hath broken the staffe of the wicked, and the scepter of the rulers.
b.ISA.14.6	He who smote the people in wrath with a continuall stroke; hee that ruled the
b.ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest and is quiet: they breake foorth into singing.
b.ISA.14.8	Yea the firre trees reioyce at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since
b.ISA.14.9	Hell from beneath is mooued for thee to meet thee at thy comming: it stirreth
b.ISA.1.5	Why should yee be stricken any more? yee will reuolt more and more: the whole
b.ISA.15.1	The burden of Moab: because in the night Ar of Moab is laide waste and brought

b.ISA.15.7	Therefore the abundance they haue gotten, and that which they haue laide vp,
b.ISA.15.8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab: the howling thereof vnto
b.ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon shalbe full of blood: for I will bring more vpon Dimon,

b.ISA.16.14	But now the Lord hath spoken, saying, Within three yeeres, as the yeeres of

b.ISA.21.5	Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eate, drinke: arise yee princes,
b.ISA.2.16	And vpon all the ships of Tarshish, and vpon all pleasant pictures.
b.ISA.21.6	For thus hath the Lord sayd vnto me; Goe, set a watchman, let him declare what

b.ISA.2.20	In that day a man shall cast his idoles of siluer, and his idoles of golde
b.ISA.2.21	To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rockes,
b.ISA.22.1	The burden of the valley of vision. What ayleth thee now, that thou art wholly
b.ISA.22.10	And ye haue numbred the houses of Ierusalem, and the houses haue yee broken
b.ISA.22.11	Ye made also a ditch betweene the two walles, for the water of the olde poole:
b.ISA.22.12	And in that day did the Lord God of hostes call to weeping and to mourning,
b.ISA.22.13	And behold ioy and gladnesse, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh,
b.ISA.22.14	And it was reuealed in mine eares by the Lord of hostes; surely this
b.ISA.22.15	Thus sayth the Lord God of hostes, Goe, get thee vnto this treasurer, euen
b.ISA.22.16	What hast thou here? And whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a

b.ISA.22.18	He will surely violently turne and tosse thee, like a ball into a large
b.ISA.22.19	And I will driue thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee
b.ISA.2.22	Cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrels: for wherein is hee to be
b.ISA.22.2	Thou that art full of stirres, a tumultuous citie, a ioyous citie: thy slaine
b.ISA.22.20	And it shall come to passe in that day, that I will call my seruant Eliakim
b.ISA.22.21	And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and
b.ISA.22.22	And the key of the house of Dauid will I lay vpon his shoulder: so he shall

b.ISA.22.7	And it shall come to passe that thy choicest valleys shall be full of charets,
b.ISA.22.8	And he discouered the couering of Iudah, and thou diddest looke in that day to
b.ISA.22.9	Ye haue seene also the breaches of the citie of Dauid, that they are many: and
b.ISA.2.3	And many people shall goe &amp; say; Come yee and let vs go vp to the
b.ISA.23.1	The burden of Tyre. Howle yee ships of Tarshish, for it is laide waste, so
b.ISA.23.10	Passe through thy land as a riuer O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more

b.ISA.23.12	And he said, Thou shalt no more reioice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of
b.ISA.23.13	Behold, the land of the Caldeans, this people was not till the Assyrian
b.ISA.23.14	Howle ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
b.ISA.23.15	And it shall come to passe in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seuentie
b.ISA.23.16	Take an harpe, goe about the city thou harlot, that hast beene forgotten,
b.ISA.23.17	And it shall come to passe after the ende of seuentie yeeres, that the Lord
b.ISA.23.18	And her merchandize and her hire shall be holinesse to the Lord: it shall not
b.ISA.23.2	Be still, yee inhabitants of the yle, thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that
b.ISA.23.3	And by great waters the seede of Sihor, the haruest of the riuer is her
b.ISA.23.4	Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea hath spoken, euen the strength of the
b.ISA.23.5	As at the report concerning Egypt, so shal they be sorely pained at the report
b.ISA.23.6	Passe ye ouer to Tarshish, howle ye inhabitants of the yle.
b.ISA.23.7	Is this your ioyous citie, whose antiquitie is of ancient dayes? her owne
b.ISA.23.8	Who hath taken this counsell against Tyre the crowning citie, whose merchants
b.ISA.23.9	The Lord of hostes hath purposed it, to staine the pride of all glory, and to
b.ISA.2.4	And hee shall iudge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they
b.ISA.24.1	Behold, the Lord maketh the earth emptie, and maketh it waste, and turneth it
b.ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken downe: euery house is shut vp, that no man
b.ISA.24.11	There is a crying for wine in the streets, all ioy is darkened, the mirth of
b.ISA.24.12	In the citie is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
b.ISA.24.13	When thus it shalbe in the midst of the land among the people: there shall be
b.ISA.24.14	They shal lift vp their voice, they shal sing, for the maiesty of the Lord,
b.ISA.24.15	Wherefore, glorifie ye the Lord in the fires, euen the Name of the Lord God
b.ISA.24.16	From the vttermost part of the earth haue we heard songs, euen glory to the
b.ISA.24.17	Feare, and the pit, &amp; the snare are vpon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
b.ISA.24.18	And it shall come to passe, that he who fleeth from the noise of the feare,
b.ISA.24.19	The earth is vtterly broken downe, the earth is cleane dissolued, the earth
b.ISA.24.2	And it shall be as with the people, so with the priest, as with the seruant,
b.ISA.24.20	The earth shall reele to and fro, like a drunkard, and shall be remooued like
b.ISA.24.21	And it shall come to passe in that day, that the Lord shall punish the hoste
b.ISA.24.22	And they shalbe gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and
b.ISA.24.23	Then the Moone shall be confounded, and the Sunne ashamed, when the Lord of
b.ISA.24.3	The land shall be vtterly emptied, and vtterly spoiled: for the Lord hath
b.ISA.24.4	The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the
b.ISA.24.5	The earth also is defiled vnder the inhabitants thereof: because they haue
b.ISA.24.6	Therefore hath the curse deuoured the earth, and they that dwell therin are
b.ISA.24.7	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merrie hearted doe sigh.
b.ISA.24.8	The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that reioyce, endeth, the ioy
b.ISA.24.9	They shall not drinke wine with a song, strong drinke shall bee bitter to them
b.ISA.2.5	O house of Iacob, come yee, and let vs walke in the light of the Lord.
b.ISA.25.1	O Lord, thou art my God, I will exalt thee, I will praise thy Name; for thou
b.ISA.25.10	For in this mountaine shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab shalbe troden
b.ISA.25.11	And hee shall spread foorth his hands in the midst of them, as hee that
b.ISA.25.12	And the fortresse of the high fort of thy walles shall hee bring downe, lay
b.ISA.25.2	For thou hast made of a citie, an heape; of a defenced city, a ruine: a palace
b.ISA.25.3	Therefore shall the strong people glorifie thee, the city of the terrible
b.ISA.25.4	For thou hast bene a strength to the poore, a strength to the needy in his
b.ISA.25.5	Thou shalt bring downe the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place;
b.ISA.25.6	And in this mountaine shall the Lord of hostes make vnto all people a feast of
b.ISA.25.7	And he wil destroy in this mountaine the face of the couering cast ouer all
b.ISA.25.8	He will swallow vp death in victorie, and the Lord God wil wipe away teares
b.ISA.25.9	And it shalbe said in that day, Loe, this is our God, we haue waited for him,
b.ISA.2.6	Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Iacob; because they be
b.ISA.26.1	In that day shall this song bee sung in the land of Iudah; Wee haue a strong
b.ISA.26.10	Let fauour be shewed to the wicked, yet will hee not learne righteousnesse:
b.ISA.26.11	Lord, when thy hand is lifted vp, they will not see: but they shall see, and
b.ISA.26.12	Lord, thou wilt ordaine peace for vs: for thou also hast wrought all our
b.ISA.26.13	O Lord our God, other lordes besides thee haue had dominion ouer vs: but by
b.ISA.26.14	They are dead, they shall not liue; they are deceased, they shall not rise:
b.ISA.26.15	Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased the nation, thou
b.ISA.26.16	Lord, in trouble haue they visited thee: they powred out a prayer when thy
b.ISA.26.17	Like as a woman with childe that draweth neere the time of her deliuerie, is
b.ISA.26.18	Wee haue beene with childe, wee haue beene in paine, we haue as it were
b.ISA.26.19	Thy dead men shall liue, together with my dead body shall they arise: awake
b.ISA.26.2	Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the trueth may
b.ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doores about
b.ISA.26.21	For behold, the Lord commeth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of
b.ISA.26.3	Thou wilt keepe him in perfect peace, whose minde is stayed on thee; because
b.ISA.26.4	Trust ye in the Lord for euer: for in the Lord Iehouah is euerlasting
b.ISA.26.5	For hee bringeth downe them that dwell on high, the loftie citie he layeth it
b.ISA.26.6	The foote shall treade it downe, euen the feete of the poore, and the steps of
b.ISA.26.7	The way of the iust is vprightnesse: thou most vpright, doest weigh the path
b.ISA.26.8	Yea in the way of thy Iudgements, O Lord, haue we waited for thee; the desire
b.ISA.26.9	With my soule haue I desired thee in the night, yea with my spirit within me
b.ISA.2.7	Their land also is full of siluer and gold, neither is there any end of their
b.ISA.27.1	In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sworde shall punish
b.ISA.27.10	Yet the defenced citie shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and
b.ISA.27.11	When the boughes thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women
b.ISA.27.12	And it shall come to passe in that day, that the Lord shall beate off from
b.ISA.27.13	And it shall come to passe in that day, that the great trumpet shall bee
b.ISA.27.2	In that day, sing yee vnto her; A vineyard of red wine.
b.ISA.27.3	I the Lord doe keepe it; I will water it euery moment: lest any hurt it, I
b.ISA.27.4	Furie is not in mee: who would set the briars and thornes against me in
b.ISA.27.5	Or let him take holde of my strength, that he may make peace with me, and he
b.ISA.27.6	Hee shall cause them that come of Iacob to take roote: Israel shall blossome
b.ISA.27.7	Hath hee smitten him, as hee smote those that smote him? or is hee slaine
b.ISA.27.8	In measure when it shooteth foorth, thou wilt debate with it: hee stayeth his
b.ISA.27.9	By this therefore shall the iniquitie of Iacob be purged, and this is all the
b.ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idoles: they worship the worke of their owne hands,
b.ISA.28.1	Woe to the crowne of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty
b.ISA.28.10	For precept must be vpon precept, precept vpon precept, line vpon line, line
b.ISA.28.11	For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speake to this people.
b.ISA.28.12	To whom he said, This is the rest wherwith ye may cause the weary to rest,
b.ISA.28.13	But the word of the Lord was vnto them, precept vpon precept, precept vpon
b.ISA.28.14	Wherefore heare the worde of the Lord, yee scornefull men, that rule this
b.ISA.28.15	Because ye haue said, Wee haue made a couenant with death, and with hell are
b.ISA.28.16	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a
b.ISA.28.17	Iudgement also will I lay to the line, and righteousnesse to the plummet: and
b.ISA.28.18	And your couenant with death shalbe disanulled, and your agreement with hell
b.ISA.28.19	From the time that it goeth forth, it shall take you: for morning by morning
b.ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord hath a mightie and strong one, which as a tempest of haile
b.ISA.28.20	For the bed is shorter, then that a man can stretch himselfe on it: and the
b.ISA.28.21	For the Lord shall rise vp as in mount Perazim, he shalbe wroth as in the
b.ISA.28.22	Now therefore be yee not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I haue
b.ISA.28.23	Giue yee eare, and heare my voyce, hearken and heare my speach.
b.ISA.28.24	Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and breake the clods of
b.ISA.28.25	When hee hath made plaine the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the
b.ISA.28.26	For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.
b.ISA.28.27	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a
b.ISA.28.28	Bread corne is bruised; because he will not euer be threshing it, nor breake
b.ISA.28.29	This also commeth forth from the Lord of hostes, which is wonderfull in
b.ISA.28.3	The crowne of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim shall be troden vnder feete.
b.ISA.28.4	And the glorious beautie which is on the head of the fat valley, shall bee a
b.ISA.28.5	In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crowne of glory, and for a
b.ISA.28.6	And for a spirit of iudgement to him that sitteth in iudgement, and for
b.ISA.28.7	But they also haue erred through wine, and through strong drinke are out of
b.ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomite and filthinesse, so that there is no place
b.ISA.28.9	Whome shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to vnderstand doctrine?
b.ISA.2.9	And the meane man boweth downe, and the great man humbleth himselfe; therefore
b.ISA.29.1	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel the citie where Dauid dwelt: adde yee yeere to yeere;
b.ISA.29.10	For the Lord hath powred out vpon you the spirit of deepe sleepe, and hath
b.ISA.29.11	And the vsion of all is become vnto you, as the wordes of a booke that is
b.ISA.29.12	And the booke is deliuered to him that is not learned, saying, Reade this, I
b.ISA.29.13	Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw neere mee with their
b.ISA.29.14	Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marueilous worke amongst this
b.ISA.29.15	Woe vnto them that seeke deepe to hide their counsell from the Lord, and
b.ISA.29.16	Surely your turning of things vpside downe shall be esteemed as the potters
b.ISA.29.17	Is it not yet a very litle while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful
b.ISA.29.18	And in that day shall the deafe heare the words of the booke, and the eyes of
b.ISA.29.19	The meeke also shall increase their ioy in the Lord, and the poore among men
b.ISA.29.2	Yet I will distresse Ariel, and there shalbe heauinesse and sorrow; and it
b.ISA.29.20	For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and
b.ISA.29.21	That make a man an offendour for a word, and lay a snare for him that
b.ISA.29.22	Therefore thus saith the Lord who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of
b.ISA.29.23	But when hee seeth his children the worke of mine hands in the midst of him,
b.ISA.29.24	They also that erred in spirit shall come to vnderstanding, and they that
b.ISA.29.3	And I will campe against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee
b.ISA.29.4	And thou shalt bee brought downe, and shalt speake out of the ground, and thy
b.ISA.29.5	Moreouer the multitude of thy strangers shalbe like small dust, and the
b.ISA.29.6	Thou shalt bee visited of the Lord of hostes with thunder, and with
b.ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, euen all that
b.ISA.29.8	It shall euen be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he
b.ISA.29.9	Stay your selues and wonder, cry yee out, and cry: they are drunken, but not
b.ISA.30.1	Woe to the rebellious children, sayth the Lord, that take counsell, but not of
b.ISA.30.10	Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophecie not vnto vs
b.ISA.30.11	Get ye out of the way: turne aside out of the path: cause the Holy one of
b.ISA.30.12	Wherefore, thus saith the Holy one of Israel: Because ye despise this word,
b.ISA.30.13	Therefore this iniquitie shalbe to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling
b.ISA.30.14	And he shall breake it as the breaking of the potters vessell, that is broken
b.ISA.30.15	For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy one of Israel, In returning and rest
b.ISA.30.16	But ye said; No, for we will flee vpon horses; therefore shall ye flee. And
b.ISA.30.17	One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one: at the rebuke of fiue, shall ye
b.ISA.30.18	And therefore wil the Lord wait that he may be gracious vnto you, and
b.ISA.30.19	For the people shall dwel in Zion at Ierusalem: thou shalt weepe no more: hee
b.ISA.30.2	That walke to goe downe into Egypt, (and haue not asked at my mouth) to
b.ISA.30.20	And though the Lord giue you the bread of aduersitie, and the water of
b.ISA.30.21	And thine eares shall heare a word behinde thee, saying; This is the way,
b.ISA.30.22	Ye shall defile also the couering of thy grauen images of siluer, and the
b.ISA.30.23	Then shall he giue the raine of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground
b.ISA.30.24	The oxen likewise and the yong asses that eare the ground, shall eate cleane
b.ISA.30.25	And there shall be vpon euery high mountaine, and vpon euery high hill,
b.ISA.30.26	Moreouer the light of the Moone shalbe as the light of the Sunne, and the
b.ISA.30.27	Beholde, the Name of the Lord commeth from farre, burning with his anger, and
b.ISA.30.28	And his breath as an ouerflowing streame, shall reach to the midst of the
b.ISA.30.29	Yee shall haue a song as in the night, when a holy solemnitie is kept, and
b.ISA.30.3	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the
b.ISA.30.30	And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the
b.ISA.30.31	For through the voyce of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten downe, which
b.ISA.30.32	And in euery place where the grounded staffe shall passe, which the Lord
b.ISA.30.33	For Tophet is ordained of olde; yea, for the king it is prepared, he hath

b.ISA.30.5	They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an helpe
b.ISA.30.6	The burden of the beastes of the South: into the lande of trouble and anguish,
b.ISA.30.7	For the Egyptians shall helpe in vaine, and to no purpose: Therefore haue I
b.ISA.30.8	Now goe, write it before them in a table, and note it in a booke, that it may
b.ISA.30.9	That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not heare
b.ISA.3.1	For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hostes doeth take away from Ierusalem, and
b.ISA.3.10	Say yee to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eate
b.ISA.3.11	Woe vnto the wicked, it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his handes
b.ISA.31.1	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for helpe, and stay on horses, and trust in
b.ISA.3.12	As for my people, children are their oppressours, and women rule ouer them: O
b.ISA.31.2	Yet he also is wise, and will bring euill, and wil not call backe his words:
b.ISA.3.13	The Lord standeth vp to plead, and standeth to iudge the people.
b.ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit:
b.ISA.3.14	The Lord will enter into iudgement with the ancients of his people, and the
b.ISA.31.4	For thus hath the Lord spoken vnto me; Like as the lyon and the yong lyon
b.ISA.3.15	What meane yee that yee beat my people to pieces, and grinde the faces of the
b.ISA.31.5	As birds flying, so wil the Lord of hostes defend Ierusalem, defending also
b.ISA.3.16	Moreouer the Lord saith; Because the daughters of Zion are hautie, and walke
b.ISA.31.6	Turne yee vnto him from whom the children of Israel haue deeply reuolted.
b.ISA.3.17	Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crowne of the head of the
b.ISA.31.7	For in that day euery man shall cast away his idoles of siluer, and his idoles
b.ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the brauery of their tinckling ornaments
b.ISA.31.8	Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mightie man; and the
b.ISA.3.19	The chaines, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
b.ISA.31.9	And hee shall passe ouer to his strong holde for feare, and his princes shall

b.ISA.3.20	The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legges, and the headbands, and the
b.ISA.3.21	The rings, and nose-iewels,
b.ISA.32.1	Behold, a King shal reigne in righteousnes, and princes shal rule in iudgement.
b.ISA.32.10	Many dayes and yeeres shall ye be troubled, yee carelesse women: for the
b.ISA.32.11	Tremble yee women that are at ease: be troubled, ye carelesse ones, strip ye
b.ISA.32.12	They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fieldes, for the fruitfull
b.ISA.32.13	Upon the land of my people shall come vp thornes, and briars, yea vpon all
b.ISA.32.14	Because the palaces shall be forsaken, the multitude of the citie shall be
b.ISA.32.15	Untill the spirit be powred vpon vs from on high, and the wildernesse be a

b.ISA.32.17	And the worke of righteousnesse shalbe peace, and the effect of
b.ISA.32.18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings,
b.ISA.32.19	When it shall haile, comming downe on the forrest; and the citie shall be low

b.ISA.32.5	The vile person shall be no more called liberall, nor the churle sayd to be
b.ISA.3.26	And her gates shall lament and mourne; and she being desolate, shall sit vpon
b.ISA.32.6	For the vile person wil speake villenie, and his heart will worke iniquitie,
b.ISA.32.7	The instruments also of the churle are euill: he deuiseth wicked deuices, to

b.ISA.33.13	Heare yee that are farre off, what I haue done; and yee that are neere,
b.ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid, fearefulnesse hath surprised the hypocrites:
b.ISA.33.15	He that walketh righteously, and speaketh vprightly, hee that despiseth the
b.ISA.33.16	He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shalbe the munitions of rocks,
b.ISA.33.17	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that
b.ISA.33.18	Thine heart shall meditate terrour; Where is the scribe? where is the

b.ISA.33.20	Looke vpon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Ierusalem
b.ISA.33.21	But there the glorious Lord will be vnto vs a place of broad riuers and
b.ISA.33.22	For the Lord is our Iudge, the Lord is our Lawgiuer, the Lord is our King, he
b.ISA.33.23	Thy tacklings are loosed: they could not well strengthen their mast, they

b.ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the people fled: at the lifting vp of thy selfe the
b.ISA.33.4	And your spoile shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as
b.ISA.33.5	The Lord is exalted: for hee dwelleth on high, he hath filled Zion with
b.ISA.33.6	And wisedome and knowledge shall be the stabilitie of thy times, and strength
b.ISA.33.7	Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadours of peace shall
b.ISA.33.8	The high wayes lye waste; the way faring man ceaseth: he hath broken the

b.ISA.34.1	Come neere ye nations to heare, and hearken ye people: let the earth heare,
b.ISA.34.10	It shal not be quenched night nor day, the smoke thereof shall goe vp for
b.ISA.34.11	The cormorant and the bitterne shall possesse it, the owle also and the rauen
b.ISA.34.12	They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdome, but none shall bee there,
b.ISA.34.13	And thornes shall come vp in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the

b.ISA.34.17	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath diuided it vnto them by
b.ISA.34.2	For the indignation of the Lord is vpon all nations, and his furie vpon all
b.ISA.34.3	Their slaine also shalbe cast out, and their stinke shall come vp out of their

b.ISA.35.10	And the ransomed of the Lord shall returne and come to Zion with songs, and
b.ISA.35.2	It shall blossome abundantly, and reioyce euen with ioy and singing: the glory
b.ISA.35.3	Strengthen yee the weake hands, and confirme the feeble knees.
b.ISA.35.4	Say to them that are of a fearefull heart; Be strong, feare not: behold, your

b.ISA.36.1	Nowe it came to passe in the fourteenth yeere of king Hezekiah, that
b.ISA.36.10	And am I now come vp without the Lord against this land to destroy it? the
b.ISA.36.11	Then sayd Eliakim and Shebna &amp; Ioah vnto Rabshakeh; Speake, I pray thee,
b.ISA.36.12	But Rabshakeh sayd; Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to
b.ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood, and cryed with a loud voice in the Iewes language, and
b.ISA.36.14	Thus saith the king; Let not Hezekiah deceiue you, for he shall not be able
b.ISA.36.15	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying; The Lord will surely
b.ISA.36.16	Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus sayth the King of Assyria, Make an
b.ISA.36.17	Until I come and take you away to a land like your owne land, a land of corne
b.ISA.36.18	Beware lest Hezekiah perswade you, saying; The Lord will deliuer vs. Hath any
b.ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath, and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharuaim?
b.ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh, from Lachish to Ierusalem, vnto king
b.ISA.36.20	Who are they amongst all the gods of these landes, that haue deliuered their
b.ISA.36.21	But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the Kings
b.ISA.36.22	Then came Eliakim the sonne of Hilkiah, that was ouer the houshold, and
b.ISA.36.3	Then came forth vnto him Eliakim Hilkiahs sonne, which was ouer the house, and
b.ISA.36.4	And Rabshakeh sayd vnto them; Say yee now to Hezekiah; Thus saith the great
b.ISA.36.5	I say, (sayest thou) (but they are but vaine words) I haue counsell and
b.ISA.36.6	Loe, thou trustest in the staffe of this broken reede, on Egypt; whereon if a
b.ISA.36.7	But if thou say to me; We trust in the Lord our God: Is it not he, whose high
b.ISA.36.8	Now therefore giue pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and
b.ISA.36.9	How then wilt thou turne away the face of one captaine of the least of my
b.ISA.3.7	In that day shall he sweare, saying, I will not be an healer: for in my house
b.ISA.37.1	And it came to passe when King Hezekiah heard it, that hee rent his clothes,
b.ISA.37.10	Thus shall ye speake to Hezekiah King of Iudah, saying, Let not thy God in
b.ISA.37.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria haue done to all lands by
b.ISA.37.12	Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed,
b.ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the
b.ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah receiued the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read
b.ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed vnto the Lord, saying,
b.ISA.37.16	O Lord of hostes, God of Israel, that dwellest betweene the Cherubims, thou
b.ISA.37.17	Encline thine eare, O Lord, and heare, Open thine eyes, O Lord, and see, and
b.ISA.37.18	Of a trueth, Lord, the kings of Assyria haue laid waste all the nations and
b.ISA.37.19	And haue cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work
b.ISA.37.2	And hee sent Eliakim, who was ouer the houshold, and Shebna the Scribe, and
b.ISA.37.20	Now therefore, O Lord our God, saue vs from his hand, that all the kingdomes
b.ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the sonne of Amoz sent vnto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord
b.ISA.37.22	This is the worde which the Lord hath spoken concerning him: The virgin, the
b.ISA.37.23	Whom hast thou reproched and blasphemed? and against whome hast thou exalted
b.ISA.37.24	By thy seruants hast thou reproched the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude
b.ISA.37.25	I haue digged and drunke water, and with the sole of my feete haue I dried vp
b.ISA.37.26	Hast thou not heard long agoe, how I haue done it, and of ancient times, that
b.ISA.37.27	Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and
b.ISA.37.28	But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy comming in, and thy rage
b.ISA.37.29	Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult is come vp into mine eares:
b.ISA.37.3	And they sayd vnto him; Thus sayth Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and
b.ISA.37.30	And this shall be a signe vnto thee, Ye shall eate this yeere such as groweth
b.ISA.37.31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Iudah, shal againe take roote
b.ISA.37.32	For out of Ierusalem shall goe forth a remnant, and they that escape out of
b.ISA.37.33	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not
b.ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he returne, and shall not come
b.ISA.37.35	For I will defend this citie to saue it, for mine owne sake, and for my
b.ISA.37.36	Then the Angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the campe of the
b.ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went, and returned, and dwelt at
b.ISA.37.38	And it came to passe as hee was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,
b.ISA.37.4	It may be the Lord thy God will heare the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of
b.ISA.37.5	So the seruants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
b.ISA.37.6	And Isaiah sayd vnto them; Thus shall yee say vnto your master, Thus sayth the
b.ISA.37.7	Behold, I will send a blast vpon him, and hee shall heare a rumour, and
b.ISA.37.8	So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah:
b.ISA.37.9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Hee is come foorth to
b.ISA.3.8	For Ierusalem is ruined, &amp; Iudah is fallen: because their tongue and their
b.ISA.38.1	In those daies was Hezekiah sicke vnto death: and Isaiah the Prophet the sonne
b.ISA.38.10	I saide in the cutting off of my dayes; I shall goe to the gates of the graue:
b.ISA.38.11	I said, I shal not see the Lord, euen the Lord in the land of the liuing: I
b.ISA.38.12	Mine age is departed, and is remoued from me as a shepheards tent: I haue cut
b.ISA.38.13	I reckoned till morning, that as a Lyon so will hee breake all my bones: from
b.ISA.38.14	Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter; I did mourne as a doue: mine
b.ISA.38.15	What shall I say? hee hath both spoken vnto mee, and himselfe hath done it: I
b.ISA.38.16	O Lord, by these things men liue: and in all these things is the life of my
b.ISA.38.17	Behold, for peace I had great bitternesse, but thou hast in loue to my soule
b.ISA.38.18	For the graue cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that goe
b.ISA.38.19	The liuing, the liuing, hee shall praise thee, as I doe this day: the father
b.ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed vnto the Lord,
b.ISA.38.20	The Lord was ready to saue me: therefore we will sing my songs to the
b.ISA.38.21	For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lumpe of figges, and lay it for a
b.ISA.38.22	Hezekiah also had said, what is the signe, that I shall goe vp to the house
b.ISA.38.3	And said, Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I haue walked before thee
b.ISA.38.4	Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,
b.ISA.38.5	Goe and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Dauid thy father; I
b.ISA.38.6	And I will deliuer thee and this citie, out of the hand of the king of
b.ISA.38.7	And this shall be a signe vnto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will doe this
b.ISA.38.8	Behold, I will bring againe the shadow of the degrees which is gone downe in
b.ISA.38.9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Iudah, when he had bene sicke, and was

b.ISA.39.1	At that time Merodach Baladan the sonne of Baladan king of Babylon, sent
b.ISA.39.2	And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious
b.ISA.39.3	Then came Isaiah the Prophet vnto King Hezekiah, and sayde vnto him, What sayd
b.ISA.39.4	Then said hee, What haue they seene in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All
b.ISA.39.5	Then sayde Isaiah to Hezekiah, Heare the word of the Lord of hostes.
b.ISA.39.6	Behold, the dayes come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy
b.ISA.39.7	And of thy sonnes that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall

b.ISA.40.1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, sayth your God.
b.ISA.40.10	Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arme shall rule for
b.ISA.40.11	He shall feede his flocke like a shepheard: he shall gather the lambes with
b.ISA.40.12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out heauen
b.ISA.40.13	Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord, or, being his counseller, hath

b.ISA.40.17	All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him lesse then
b.ISA.40.18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likenesse will ye compare vnto him?
b.ISA.40.19	The workeman melteth a grauen image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it ouer with
b.ISA.40.2	Speake ye comfortably to Ierusalem, and cry vnto her, that her warrefare is
b.ISA.40.20	He that is so impouerished that he hath no oblation, chooseth a tree that
b.ISA.40.21	Haue yee not knowen? haue yee not heard? hath it not beene tolde you from the
b.ISA.40.22	It is he that sitteth vpon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants
b.ISA.40.23	That bringeth the princes to nothing; hee maketh the Iudges of the earth as

b.ISA.40.26	Lift vp your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that
b.ISA.40.27	Why sayest thou, O Iacob, and speakest O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord,
b.ISA.40.28	Hast thou not knowen? hast thou not heard, that the euerlasting God, the

b.ISA.43.10	Yee are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my seruant whom I haue chosen: that
b.ISA.43.11	I, euen I am the Lord, and beside me there is no Sauiour.
b.ISA.43.12	I haue declared, and haue saued, and I haue shewed, when there was no strange
b.ISA.43.13	Yea before the day was, I am hee; and there is none that can deliuer out of

b.ISA.43.15	I am the Lord, your Holy one, the Creatour of Israel, your King.
b.ISA.43.16	Thus sayth the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mightie
b.ISA.43.17	Which bringeth foorth the charet and horse, the armie and the power: they
b.ISA.43.18	Remember yee not the former things, neither consider the things of olde.
b.ISA.43.19	Behold, I will doe a new thing: now it shall spring foorth, shall yee not
b.ISA.43.2	When thou passest through the waters, I wil be with thee; and through the
b.ISA.43.20	The beast of the field shall honor mee, the dragons and the owles, because I
b.ISA.43.21	This people haue I formed for my selfe, they shall shewe foorth my praise.
b.ISA.43.22	But thou hast not called vpon me, O Iacob, but thou hast beene wearie of me,
b.ISA.43.23	Thou hast not brought mee the small cattell of thy burnt offrings, neither
b.ISA.43.24	Thou hast bought mee no sweete cane with money, neither hast thou filled mee

b.ISA.43.27	Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers haue transgressed against mee.
b.ISA.43.28	Therefore I haue profaned the princes of the Sanctuarie, and haue giuen Iacob
b.ISA.43.3	For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy one of Israel, thy Sauiour: I gaue Egypt
b.ISA.43.4	Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast bene honourable, and I haue
b.ISA.43.5	Feare not, for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the East, and gather
b.ISA.43.6	I wil say to the North, Giue vp; and to the South, Keepe not backe: bring my

b.ISA.43.8	Bring foorth the blinde people, that haue eyes; and the deafe that haue eares.
b.ISA.43.9	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who

b.ISA.44.1	Yet now heare, O Iacob my seruant, and Israel whom I haue chosen.
b.ISA.44.10	Who hath formed a God, or moulten a grauen image that is profitable for
b.ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellowes shall be ashamed: and the workemen, they are of men:
b.ISA.44.12	The smith with the tonges both worketh in the coales, and fashioneth it with
b.ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretcheth out his rule: he maketh it out with the line: he
b.ISA.44.14	He heweth him downe cedars, and taketh the Cypresse and the Oke, which he
b.ISA.44.15	Then shall it bee for a man to burne: for hee will take thereof and warme
b.ISA.44.16	He burneth part thereof in the fire: with part thereof he eateth flesh: he
b.ISA.44.17	And the residue thereof he maketh a God, euen his grauen image: hee falleth
b.ISA.44.18	They haue not knowen, nor vnderstood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they
b.ISA.44.19	And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor
b.ISA.44.2	Thus sayeth the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the wombe, which wil
b.ISA.44.20	He feedeth of ashes: a deceiued heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot
b.ISA.44.21	Remember these (O Iacob and Israel) for thou art my seruant: I haue formed
b.ISA.44.22	I haue blotted out, as a thicke cloude, thy transgressions, and as a a cloud,
b.ISA.44.23	Sing, O yee heauens; for the Lord hath done it: shout yee lower parts of the
b.ISA.44.24	Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the wombe; I
b.ISA.44.25	That frustrateth the tokens of the lyers, and maketh diuiners mad, that
b.ISA.44.26	That confirmeth the word of his seruant, and performeth the counsell of his
b.ISA.44.27	That saith to the deepe; Be dry, and I will drie vp thy riuers.
b.ISA.44.28	That saith of Cyrus, Hee is my shepheard, and shall performe all my pleasure,
b.ISA.44.3	For I will powre water vpon him that is thirstie, and floods vpon the dry
b.ISA.44.4	And they shall spring vp as among the grasse, as willowes by the water
b.ISA.44.5	One shall say, I am the Lords: and another shall call himselfe by the name of
b.ISA.44.6	Thus saith the Lord the king of Israel and his redeemer the Lord of hostes, I
b.ISA.44.7	And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me,
b.ISA.44.8	Feare yee not, neither be afraid: haue not I told thee from that time, and
b.ISA.44.9	They that make a grauen image are all of them vanitie, and their delectable
b.ISA.4.5	And the Lord will create vpon euery dwelling place of mount Zion, and vpon her
b.ISA.45.1	Thus saith the Lord to his Anointed, to Cyrus whose right hande I haue holden,
b.ISA.45.10	Woe vnto him that saith vnto his father, What begettest thou? or to the
b.ISA.45.11	Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his maker, Aske me of things
b.ISA.45.12	I haue made the earth, and created man vpon it: I, euen my handes haue
b.ISA.45.13	I haue raised him vp in righteousnesse, and I will direct all his wayes: he

b.ISA.45.15	Uerely thou art a God that hidest thy selfe, O God of Israel the Sauiour.
b.ISA.45.16	They shall be ashamed, and also confounded all of them: they shall goe to
b.ISA.45.17	But Israel shall bee saued in the Lord with an euerlasting saluation: ye
b.ISA.45.18	For thus saith the Lord that created the heauens, God himselfe that formed
b.ISA.45.19	I haue not spoken in secret, in a darke place of the earth: I said not vnto
b.ISA.45.2	I will goe before thee, and make the crooked places straight, I wil break in
b.ISA.45.20	Assemble your selues and come: draw neere together ye that are escaped of the
b.ISA.45.21	Tell ye and bring them neere, yea let them take counsell together, who hath
b.ISA.45.22	Looke vnto mee, and be ye saued all the endes of the earth: for I am God, and
b.ISA.45.23	I haue sworne by my selfe: the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousnes,
b.ISA.45.24	Surely, shall one say, In the Lord haue I righteousnesse and strength: euen
b.ISA.45.25	In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be iustified, and shall glory.
b.ISA.45.3	And I will giue thee the treasures of darkenesse, &amp; hidden riches of

b.ISA.45.6	That they may knowe from the rising of the Sun, and from the West, that there
b.ISA.45.7	I forme the light, and create darkenesse: I make peace, and create euill: I
b.ISA.45.8	Drop downe, ye heauens, from aboue, and let the skies powre downe
b.ISA.45.9	Woe vnto him that striueth with his maker: Let the potsheard striue with the

b.ISA.47.12	Stand now with thine inchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries,
b.ISA.47.13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers,
b.ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble: the fire shall burne them, they shall not

b.ISA.47.2	Take the milstones and grinde meale, vncouer thy lockes: make bare the legge:
b.ISA.47.3	Thy nakednes shalbe vncouered, yea thy shame shalbe seene: I will take
b.ISA.47.4	As for our redeemer, the Lord of hostes is his Name, the Holy one of Israel.
b.ISA.47.5	Sit thou silent, and get thee into darknes, O daughter of the Caldeans: for
b.ISA.47.6	I was wroth with my people: I haue polluted mine inheritance, and giuen them
b.ISA.47.7	And thou saydst, I shall bee a Ladie for euer: so that thou didst not lay
b.ISA.47.8	Therefore heare now this, thou that art giuen to pleasures, that dwellest
b.ISA.47.9	But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day; the losse of

b.ISA.48.18	O that thou haddest hearkened to my commandements! Then had thy peace beene
b.ISA.48.19	Thy seede also had beene as the sand, and the ofspring of thy bowels like the

b.ISA.48.22	There is no peace, saith the Lord, vnto the wicked.
b.ISA.48.3	I haue declared the former things from the beginning: and they went foorth out
b.ISA.48.4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy necke is an yron sinew, and
b.ISA.48.5	I haue euen from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to passe I
b.ISA.48.6	Thou hast heard, see all this, and will not yee declare it? I haue shewed thee
b.ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not from the beginning, euen before the day when
b.ISA.48.8	Yea thou heardest not, yea thou knewest not, yea from that time that thine

b.ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not haue compassion on

b.ISA.49.17	Thy children shal make haste, thy destroyers, and they that made thee waste,
b.ISA.49.18	Lift vp thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselues
b.ISA.49.19	For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction shall

b.ISA.49.23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queenes thy nursing
b.ISA.49.24	Shall the pray be taken from the mightie, or the lawfull captiue deliuered?
b.ISA.49.25	But thus saith the Lord, Euen the captiues of the mightie shall be taken
b.ISA.49.26	And I will feede them that oppresse thee, with their owne flesh, and they
b.ISA.49.3	And sayd vnto me; Thou art my seruant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
b.ISA.49.4	Then I said; I haue laboured in vaine, I haue spent my strength for nought,
b.ISA.49.5	And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the wombe to be his seruant, to
b.ISA.49.6	And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my seruant to raise vp
b.ISA.49.7	Thus saith the Lord the redeemer of Israel, and his holy one, to him whom man

b.ISA.50.4	The Lord God hath giuen me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how
b.ISA.50.5	The Lord God hath opened mine eare, and I was not rebellious, neither turned
b.ISA.50.6	I gaue my backe to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the

b.ISA.50.8	He is neere that iustifieth me, who will contend with me? let vs stand
b.ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord God wil helpe me, who is he that shall condemne mee? Loe,
b.ISA.5.1	Now will I sing to my welbeloued, a song of my beloued touching his vineyard:
b.ISA.5.10	Yea ten acres of vineyard shall yeeld one Bath, and the seed of an Homer
b.ISA.5.11	Woe vnto them that rise vp earely in the morning, that they may follow strong
b.ISA.51.1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousnesse, ye that seeke the Lord:
b.ISA.51.10	Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deepe, that
b.ISA.51.11	Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall returne, and come with singing vnto
b.ISA.51.12	I, euen I am hee that comforteth you, who art thou that thou shouldest be
b.ISA.51.13	And forgettest the Lord thy maker that hath stretched foorth the heauens, and
b.ISA.51.14	The captiue exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that hee should not

b.ISA.51.19	These two things are come vnto thee; who shall be sorie for thee? desolation
b.ISA.5.12	And the harpe and the viole, the tabret and pipe, and wine are in their

b.ISA.51.22	Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his

b.ISA.5.13	Therefore my people are gone into captiuitie, because they haue no knowledge:
b.ISA.51.3	For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he wil comfort all her waste places, and he

b.ISA.51.4	Hearken vnto me, my people, and giue eare vnto me, O my nation: for a Law
b.ISA.5.15	And the meane man shall bee brought downe, and the mightie man shall be
b.ISA.51.5	My righteousnes is neere: my saluation is gone foorth, and mine armes shall

b.ISA.51.6	Lift vp your eyes to the heauens, and looke vpon the earth beneath: for the
b.ISA.5.17	Then shall the lambes feed after their maner, and the waste places of the fat
b.ISA.51.7	Hearken vnto me ye that know righteousnesse, the people in whose heart is my
b.ISA.5.18	Woe vnto them that draw iniquitie with cords of vanitie, and sinne, as it
b.ISA.51.8	For the moth shall eate them vp like a garment, and the worme shal eate them
b.ISA.5.19	That say, Let him make speede, and hasten his worke, that we may see it: and
b.ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arme of the Lord, awake as in the ancient
b.ISA.5.2	And hee fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with
b.ISA.5.20	Woe vnto them that call euill good, and good euill, that put darkenes for
b.ISA.5.21	Woe vnto them that are wise in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne
b.ISA.52.1	Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion, put on thy beautifull garments, O
b.ISA.52.10	The Lord hath made bare his holy arme in the eyes of all the nations, and all
b.ISA.52.11	Depart ye, depart ye, goe ye out from thence, touch no vncleane thing; goe ye
b.ISA.52.12	For ye shall not go out with haste, nor goe by flight: for the Lord will goe
b.ISA.52.13	Behold, my seruant shal deale prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled,
b.ISA.52.14	As many were astonied at thee (his visage was so marred more then any man,
b.ISA.52.15	So shall hee sprinckle many nations, the kings shall shut their mouthes at
b.ISA.5.22	Woe vnto them that are mightie to drinke wine, and men of strength to mingle
b.ISA.52.2	Shake thy selfe from the dust: arise, and sit downe, O Ierusalem: loose thy
b.ISA.5.23	Which iustifie the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousnes of the
b.ISA.52.3	For thus sayth the Lord, Yee haue solde your selues for nought: and ye shall
b.ISA.5.24	Therfore as the fire deuoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the
b.ISA.52.4	For thus saith the Lord God, My people went downe aforetime into Egypt to
b.ISA.5.25	Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath
b.ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what haue I here, sayth the Lord, that my people is taken away
b.ISA.5.26	And he will lift vp an ensigne to the nations from farre, and wil hisse vnto
b.ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my Name: therefore they shall know in that day,
b.ISA.5.27	None shalbe weary, nor stumble amongst them: none shall slumber nor sleepe,
b.ISA.52.7	How beautifull vpon the mountaines are the feete of him that bringeth good
b.ISA.5.28	Whose arrowes are sharpe, and all their bowes bent, their horses hoofs shall

b.ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Ierusalem, and men of Iudah, Iudge, I pray you,
b.ISA.5.30	And in that day they shall roare against them, like the roaring of the sea:
b.ISA.53.1	Who hath beleeued our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed?
b.ISA.53.10	Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put him to griefe: when thou
b.ISA.53.11	He shall see of the trauell of his soule, and shalbe satisfied: by his
b.ISA.53.12	Therefore will I diuide him a portion with the great, and he shall diuide the
b.ISA.53.2	For he shall grow vp before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a drie
b.ISA.53.3	He is despised and reiected of men, a man ofsorrows, and acquainted with
b.ISA.53.4	Surely he hath borne our griefes, and caried our sorrowes: yet we did esteeme
b.ISA.53.5	But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities:
b.ISA.53.6	All we like sheepe haue gone astray: we haue turned euery one to his owne way,
b.ISA.53.7	He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is
b.ISA.53.8	He was taken from prison, and from iudgement: and who shall declare his
b.ISA.53.9	And he made his graue with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, because
b.ISA.5.4	What could haue beene done more to my Uineyard, that I haue not done in it?
b.ISA.54.1	Sing O barren thou that didst not beare; breake forth into singing, and crie
b.ISA.54.10	For the mountaines shall depart, and the hilles be remoued, but my kindnesse

b.ISA.54.14	In righteousnesse shalt thou be established: thou shalt be farre from
b.ISA.54.15	Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoeuer shal
b.ISA.54.16	Behold, I haue created the smith that bloweth the coales in the fire, and
b.ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against thee, shall prosper, and euery tongue that
b.ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtaines of
b.ISA.54.3	For thou shalt breake forth on the right hand, and on the left; and thy seed
b.ISA.54.4	Feare not: for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded, for thou
b.ISA.54.5	For thy maker is thine husband, (the Lord of hostes is his name;) and thy
b.ISA.54.6	For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken, and grieued in spirit, and
b.ISA.54.7	For a small moment haue I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather
b.ISA.54.8	In a litle wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with euerlasting
b.ISA.54.9	For this is as the waters of Noah vnto me: for as I haue sworne that the

b.ISA.55.11	So shall my word bee that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not returne
b.ISA.55.12	For ye shall goe out with ioy, and bee led foorth with peace: the mountaines
b.ISA.55.13	In stead of the thorne shall come vp the Firre tree, and in stead of the
b.ISA.55.2	Wherefore doe yee spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for
b.ISA.55.3	Incline your eare, and come vnto me: heare, and your soule shall liue, and I
b.ISA.55.4	Behold, I haue giuen him for a witnesse to the people, a leader and commander
b.ISA.55.5	Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew

b.ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way, &amp; the vnrighteous man his thoughts: and
b.ISA.55.8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes my wayes, saith
b.ISA.55.9	For as the heauens are higher then the earth, so are my wayes higher then your
b.ISA.5.6	And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned, nor digged, but there shall
b.ISA.56.1	Thus saith the Lord, Keepe yee iudgement, and doe iustice: for my saluation is
b.ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blinde: they are all ignorant, they are all dumbe dogs, they
b.ISA.56.11	Yea they are greedy dogges which can neuer haue ynough, and they are
b.ISA.56.12	Come ye, say they, I wil fetch wine, and we will fill our selues with strong
b.ISA.56.2	Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the sonne of man that layeth holde on
b.ISA.56.3	Neither let the sonne of the stranger, that hath ioyned himselfe to the Lord,
b.ISA.56.4	For thus saith the Lord vnto the Eunuches that keep my Sabbaths, and choose

b.ISA.56.7	Euen them will I bring to my holy mountaine, and make them ioyfull in my house
b.ISA.56.8	The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather
b.ISA.56.9	All ye beasts of the field, come to deuoure, yea all ye beasts in the forest.
b.ISA.5.7	For the Uineyard of the Lord of hostes is the house of Israel, and the men of
b.ISA.57.1	The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and mercifull men are
b.ISA.57.10	Thou art wearied in the greatnesse of thy way; yet saydst thou not, There is
b.ISA.57.11	And of whom hast thou bene afraid or feared, that thou hast lyed, and hast
b.ISA.57.12	I will declare thy righteousnes; and thy workes, for they shall not profit
b.ISA.57.13	When thou criest, let thy companies deliuer thee: but the winde shall cary
b.ISA.57.14	And shall say, Cast yee vp, cast yee vp; prepare the way, take vp the
b.ISA.57.15	For thus saith the High and loftie One that inhabiteth eternitie, whose Name
b.ISA.57.16	For I will not contend for euer, neither will I be alwayes wroth: for the
b.ISA.57.17	For the iniquitie of his couetousnesse was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me,
b.ISA.57.18	I haue seene his wayes, and will heale him: I will leade him also, and
b.ISA.57.19	I create the fruite of the lippes; peace, peace to him that is farre off, and
b.ISA.57.2	Hee shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in
b.ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters
b.ISA.57.21	There is no peace, sayth my God, to the wicked.
b.ISA.57.3	But draw neere hither, yee sonnes of the sorceresse, the seed of the
b.ISA.57.4	Against whom doe ye sport your selues? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and
b.ISA.57.5	Inflaming your selues with idoles vnder euery greene tree, slaying the
b.ISA.57.6	Among the smooth stones of the streame is thy portion; they, they are thy lot:
b.ISA.57.7	Upon a loftie and high mountaine hast thou set thy bed: euen thither wentest
b.ISA.57.8	Behinde the doores also and the posts hast thou set vp thy remembrance: for
b.ISA.57.9	And thou wentest to the king with oyntment, and didst increase thy perfumes,
b.ISA.5.8	Woe vnto them that ioyne house to house, that lay field to field, till there
b.ISA.58.1	Crie aloude, spare not, lift vp thy voice like a trumpet, and shewe my people
b.ISA.58.10	And if thou draw out thy soule to the hungry, and satisfie the afflicted
b.ISA.58.11	And the Lord shal guide thee continually, and satisfie thy soule in drought,
b.ISA.58.12	And they that shall be of thee, shall builde the olde waste places: thou
b.ISA.58.13	If thou turne away thy foote from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my
b.ISA.58.14	Then shalt thou delight thy selfe in the Lord, and I will cause thee to ride
b.ISA.58.2	Yet they seeke mee daily, and delight to know my wayes, as a nation that did
b.ISA.58.3	Wherefore haue wee fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore haue wee
b.ISA.58.4	Behold, yee fast for strife and debate; and to smite with the fist of
b.ISA.58.5	Is it such a fast that I haue chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soule? Is
b.ISA.58.6	Is not this the fast that I haue chosen? to loose the bandes of wickednesse,
b.ISA.58.7	Is it not, to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poore
b.ISA.58.8	Then shall thy light breake foorth as the morning, and thine health shall
b.ISA.58.9	Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answere; thou shalt cry, and he shal
b.ISA.5.9	In mine eares said the Lord of hostes, Of a trueth many houses shall be
b.ISA.59.1	Beholde, the Lords hand is not shortened, that it cannot saue: neither his
b.ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eies: we
b.ISA.59.11	We roare all like beares, and mourne sore like doues: we looke for iudgement,
b.ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sinnes testifie
b.ISA.59.13	In transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God,
b.ISA.59.14	And iudgement is turned away backward, and iustice standeth a farre off: for
b.ISA.59.15	Yea truth faileth, and he that departeth from euill maketh himselfe a pray:
b.ISA.59.16	And hee saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
b.ISA.59.17	For he put on righteousnesse as a brestplate, and an helmet of saluation vpon
b.ISA.59.18	According to their deedes accordingly he will repay, furie to his aduersaries,
b.ISA.59.19	So shall they feare the name of the Lord from the West, and his glory from
b.ISA.59.2	But your iniquities haue separated betweene you and your God, and your sinnes
b.ISA.59.20	And the redeemer shall come to Zion, and vnto them that turne from
b.ISA.59.21	As for me, this is my couenant with them, saith the Lord; My spirit that is
b.ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquitie, your
b.ISA.59.4	None calleth for iustice, nor any pleadeth for trueth: they trust in vanity
b.ISA.59.5	They hatch cockatrice egges, and weaue the spiders web: he that eateth of
b.ISA.59.6	Their webbes shall not become garments, neither shall they couer themselues
b.ISA.59.7	Their feete runne to euill, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their
b.ISA.59.8	The way of peace they know not, and there is no iudgement in their goings:
b.ISA.59.9	Therefore is iudgement farre from vs, neither doth iustice ouertake vs: we
b.ISA.60.1	Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen vpon
b.ISA.60.10	And the sonnes of strangers shall build vp thy walles, and their kings shal
b.ISA.60.11	Therefore thy gates shal be open continually, they shall not bee shut day nor
b.ISA.60.12	For the nation and kingdome that will not serue thee, shall perish, yea those
b.ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shal come vnto thee, the Firre tree, the Pine tree, and
b.ISA.60.14	The sonnes also of them that afflicted thee, shall come bending vnto thee:
b.ISA.60.15	Whereas thou hast bene forsaken and hated, so that no man went thorow thee, I
b.ISA.60.16	Thou shalt also sucke the milke of the Gentiles, and shalt sucke the brest of
b.ISA.60.17	For brasse I will bring gold, and for yron I will bring siluer, and for wood
b.ISA.60.18	Uiolence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within
b.ISA.60.19	The Sunne shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightnesse shall
b.ISA.60.2	For behold, the darknesse shall couer the earth, and grosse darknesse the
b.ISA.60.20	Thy Sunne shall no more goe downe, neither shall thy moone withdraw it selfe:
b.ISA.60.21	Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shal inherit the land for euer,
b.ISA.60.22	A litle one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the
b.ISA.60.3	And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightnesse of thy
b.ISA.60.4	Lift vp thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselues together,
b.ISA.60.5	Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall feare and be
b.ISA.60.6	The multitude of camels shall couer thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah:
b.ISA.60.7	All the flockes of Kedar shall be gathered together vnto thee, the rams of
b.ISA.60.8	Who are these that flie as a cloude, and as the doues to their windowes?
b.ISA.60.9	Surely the yles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring
b.ISA.6.1	In the yeere that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting vpon a throne,
b.ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heauy, and shut their
b.ISA.6.11	Then sayd I; Lord, how long? And hee answered, Untill the cities be wasted
b.ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Lord God is vpon me, because the Lord hath anointed me, to
b.ISA.61.10	I will greatly reioyce in the Lord, my soule shalbe ioyfull in my God: for he
b.ISA.61.11	For as the earth bringeth foorth her bud, and as the garden causeth the
b.ISA.6.12	And the Lord haue remoued men farre away, and there be a great forsaking in
b.ISA.61.2	To proclaime the acceptable yere of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our
b.ISA.6.13	But yet in it shalbe a tenth, and it shall returne, and shall be eaten: as a
b.ISA.61.3	To appoint vnto them that mourne in Zion, to giue vnto them beautie for ashes,
b.ISA.61.4	And they shall build the olde wastes, they shall raise vp the former
b.ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flockes, and the sonnes of the alient
b.ISA.61.6	But ye shalbe named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the ministers
b.ISA.61.7	For your shame you shall haue double; and for confusion they shall reioyce in
b.ISA.61.8	For I the Lord loue Iudgement, I hate robbery for burnt offering, and I will
b.ISA.61.9	And their seed shalbe knowen among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the
b.ISA.6.2	Aboue it stood the Seraphims: each one had sixe wings, with twaine he couered
b.ISA.62.1	For Zions sake, wil I not hold my peace, and for Ierusalems sake I will not
b.ISA.62.10	Goe through, goe through the gates: prepare you the way of the people: cast
b.ISA.62.11	Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed vnto the end of the world, say ye to the
b.ISA.62.12	And they shall call them, The holy people: the redeemed of the Lord: and thou
b.ISA.62.2	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousnes, and all Kings thy glory: and thou
b.ISA.62.3	Thou shalt also be a crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royall
b.ISA.62.4	Thou shalt no more bee termed, Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be
b.ISA.62.5	For as a yong man marrieth a virgine, so shall thy sonnes marry thee: and as
b.ISA.62.6	I haue set watchmen vpon thy walles, O Ierusalem, which shall neuer hold their
b.ISA.62.7	And giue him no rest till he establish, and till hee make Ierusalem a praise
b.ISA.62.8	The Lord hath sworne by his Right hand, and by the arme of his strength,
b.ISA.62.9	But they that haue gathered it shall eat it, and praise the Lord, and they
b.ISA.6.3	And one cryed vnto another, and sayd; Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hostes,
b.ISA.63.1	Who is this that commeth from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah? this that
b.ISA.63.10	But they rebelled, and vexed his holy spirit: therefore hee was turned to be
b.ISA.63.11	Then he remembred the dayes of old, Moses and his people, saying; Where is
b.ISA.63.12	That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arme, diuiding the
b.ISA.63.13	That led them through the deepe as an horse in the wildernesse, that they
b.ISA.63.14	As a beast goeth downe into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused him to
b.ISA.63.15	Looke downe from heauen, and behold from the habitation of thy holinesse, and
b.ISA.63.16	Doubtlesse thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of vs, and Israel
b.ISA.63.17	O Lord, why hast thou made vs to erre from thy wayes? and hardened our heart
b.ISA.63.18	The people of thy holinesse haue possessed it but a little while: our
b.ISA.63.19	Wee are thine, thou neuer barest rule ouer them, they were not called by thy
b.ISA.63.2	Wherefore art thou red in thine apparell, and thy garments like him that
b.ISA.63.3	I haue troden the winepresse alone, and of the people there was none with me:
b.ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the yeere of my redeemed is
b.ISA.63.5	And I looked, and there was none to helpe; and I wondered that there was none
b.ISA.63.6	And I will tread downe the people in mine anger, &amp; make them drunke in my
b.ISA.63.7	I will mention the louing kindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord,
b.ISA.63.8	For hee said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so hee
b.ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saued
b.ISA.6.4	And the posts of the doore moued at the voyce of him that cryed, and the house
b.ISA.64.1	Oh that thou wouldest rent the heauens, that thou wouldest come down, that the
b.ISA.64.10	Thy holy cities are a wildernesse, Zion is a wildernesse, Ierusalem a
b.ISA.64.11	Our holy and our beautifull house, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt
b.ISA.64.12	Wilt thou refraine thy selfe for these things, O Lord? wilt thou hold thy
b.ISA.64.2	As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boyle: to
b.ISA.64.3	When thou diddest terrible things which wee looked not for, thou camest downe,
b.ISA.64.4	For since the beginning of the world men haue not heard, nor perceiued by the
b.ISA.64.5	Thou meetest him that reioyceth, and worketh righteousnesse, those that
b.ISA.64.6	But we are al as an vncleane thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy
b.ISA.64.7	And there is none that calleth vpon thy name, that stirreth vp himselfe to
b.ISA.64.8	But now, O Lord, thou art our father: we are the clay, and thou our potter,
b.ISA.64.9	Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquitie for euer: behold,
b.ISA.6.5	Then sayd I; woe is me; for I am vndone, because I am a man of vncleane lippes,
b.ISA.65.1	I am sought of them that asked not for me: I am found of them that sought me
b.ISA.65.10	And Sharon shall be a fold of flockes, and the valley of Achor a place for
b.ISA.65.11	But yee are they that for sake the Lord, that forget my holy mountaine, that
b.ISA.65.12	Therefore will I number you to the sword, and yee shall all bow downe to the
b.ISA.65.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, my seruants shall eate, but ye
b.ISA.65.14	Behold, my seruants shall sing for ioy of heart, but yee shall cry for sorrow
b.ISA.65.15	And yee shall leaue your name for a curse vnto my chosen: for the Lord God
b.ISA.65.16	That he who blesseth himselfe in the earth, shall blesse himselfe in the God
b.ISA.65.17	For behold, I create new heauens, and a new earth: &amp; the former shal not
b.ISA.65.18	But bee you glad and reioyce for euer in that which I create: for beholde, I
b.ISA.65.19	And I wil reioyce in Ierusalem, and ioy in my people, and the voice of
b.ISA.65.2	I haue spread out my hands all the day vnto a rebellious people, which walketh
b.ISA.65.20	There shalbe no more thence an infant of dayes, nor an olde man, that hath
b.ISA.65.21	And they shall builde houses, and inhabite them, and they shall plant
b.ISA.65.22	They shal not build, and another inhabit: they shall not plant, and another
b.ISA.65.23	They shall not labour in vaine, nor bring forth for trouble: for they are the
b.ISA.65.24	And it shal come to passe, that before they call, I will answere, &amp;
b.ISA.65.25	The wolfe and the lambe shall feede together, and the lyon shall eate straw
b.ISA.65.3	A people that prouoketh mee to anger continually to my face, that sacrificeth
b.ISA.65.4	Which remaine among the graues, and lodge in the monuments, which eate swines
b.ISA.65.5	Which say; Stand by thy selfe, come not neere to me; for I am holier then
b.ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before me: I will not keepe silence, but will recompence,
b.ISA.65.7	Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, (saith the Lord)
b.ISA.65.8	Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith,
b.ISA.65.9	And I will bring forth a seede out of Iacob, and out of Iudah an inheritour of
b.ISA.6.6	Then flew one of the Seraphims vnto mee, hauing a liue-cole in his hand, which
b.ISA.66.1	Thus sayth the Lord, The heauen is my throne, and the earth is my footestoole:
b.ISA.66.10	Reioyce ye with Ierusalem, and be glad with her, all yee that loue her:
b.ISA.66.11	That ye may sucke and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations: that
b.ISA.66.12	For thus sayth the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a riuer, and
b.ISA.66.13	As one whom his mother comforteth, so wil I comfort you: and ye shall be
b.ISA.66.14	And when yee see this, your heart shall reioyce, and your bones shall
b.ISA.66.15	For behold, the Lord wil come with fire, and with his charets like a
b.ISA.66.16	For by fire and by his sword, will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the
b.ISA.66.17	They that sanctifie themselues, and purifie themselues in the gardens,
b.ISA.66.18	For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come that I will gather
b.ISA.66.19	And I will set a signe among them, and I will send those that escape of them
b.ISA.66.2	For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things haue beene,
b.ISA.66.20	And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering vnto the Lord, out of
b.ISA.66.21	And I will also take of them for Priestes and for Leuites, saith the Lord.
b.ISA.66.22	For as the new heauens, and the new earth which I wil make, shall remaine
b.ISA.66.23	And it shall come to passe, that from one new Moone to an other, and from one
b.ISA.66.24	And they shall goe foorth, and looke vpon the carkeises of the men that haue
b.ISA.66.3	He that killeth an oxe is as if he slue a man: he that sacrificeth a lambe, as
b.ISA.66.4	I also will chuse their delusions, and will bring their feares vpon them;
b.ISA.66.5	Heare the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that
b.ISA.66.6	A voice of noyse from the city, a voice from the Temple, a voice of the Lord,
b.ISA.66.7	Before she trauailed, she brought foorth: before her paine came, shee was
b.ISA.66.8	Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seene such things? shall the earth be
b.ISA.66.9	Shall I bring to the birth, &amp; not cause to bring forth, saith the Lord ?
b.ISA.6.7	And he laide it vpon my mouth, and sayd, Loe, this hath touched thy lippes,
b.ISA.6.8	Also I heard the voyce of the Lord, saying; Whom shall I send, and who will
b.ISA.6.9	And he sayd, Goe and tell this people; Heare yee indeede, but vnderstand not:
b.ISA.7.1	And it came to passe in the dayes of Ahaz the sonne of Iotham, the sonne of
b.ISA.7.10	Moreouer the Lord spake againe vnto Ahaz, saying;
b.ISA.7.11	Aske thee a signe of the Lord thy God; aske it either in the depth, or in the
b.ISA.7.12	But Ahaz sayd, I will not aske, neither will I tempt the Lord.
b.ISA.7.13	And he sayd; Heare yee now, O house of Dauid; Is it a small thing for you to
b.ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himselfe shal giue you a signe: Behold, a Uirgine shall
b.ISA.7.15	Butter and hony shall he eat, that hee may know to refuse the euill, and
b.ISA.7.16	For before the childe shall know to refuse the euill and choose the good; the
b.ISA.7.17	The Lord shall bring vpon thee and vpon thy people, and vpon thy fathers
b.ISA.7.18	And it shall come to passe in that day, that the Lord shall hisse for the
b.ISA.7.19	And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and
b.ISA.7.2	And it was told the house of Dauid, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim:
b.ISA.7.20	In the same day shall the Lord shaue with a rasor that is hired, namely by
b.ISA.7.21	And it shall come to passe in that day, that a man shal nourish a yong cow
b.ISA.7.22	And it shall come to passe, for the abundance of milke that they shall giue,
b.ISA.7.23	And it shall come to passe in that day, that euery place shalbe, where there
b.ISA.7.24	With arrowes and with bowes shall men come thither; because all the land
b.ISA.7.25	And on all hilles that shalbe digged with the mattocke, there shall not come
b.ISA.7.3	Then sayd the Lord vnto Isaiah; Goe forth now to meete Ahaz, thou, &amp;
b.ISA.7.4	And say vnto him; Take heede and be quiet: feare not, neither be faint hearted
b.ISA.7.5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the sonne of Remaliah haue taken euill counsell
b.ISA.7.6	Let vs goe vp against Iudah and vexe it, and let vs make a breach therein for
b.ISA.7.7	Thus saith the Lord God; It shall not stand, neither shall it come to passe.
b.ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin, and
b.ISA.7.9	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliahs sonne:
b.ISA.8.1	Moreouer the Lord said vnto mee, Take thee a great roule, and write in it with
b.ISA.8.10	Take counsell together, and it shall come to nought: speake the word, and it
b.ISA.8.11	For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I
b.ISA.8.12	Say ye not, A confederacie to all them, to whom this people shall say, A
b.ISA.8.13	Sanctifie the Lord of hostes himselfe, and let him bee your feare, and let
b.ISA.8.14	And he shalbe for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rocke
b.ISA.8.15	And many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and
b.ISA.8.16	Binde vp the Testimonie, seale the Law among my disciples.
b.ISA.8.17	And I wil wait vpon the Lord that hideth his face from the house of Iacob,
b.ISA.8.18	Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord hath giuen me, are for signes, and
b.ISA.8.19	And when they shall say vnto you; Seeke vnto them that haue familiar spirits,
b.ISA.8.2	And I tooke vnto mee faithfull witnesses to record, Uriah the Priest, and
b.ISA.8.20	To the Law and to the Testimonie: if they speake not according to this word,
b.ISA.8.21	And they shall passe through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come
b.ISA.8.22	And they shall looke vnto the earth: and behold trouble and darkenesse,
b.ISA.8.3	And I went vnto the Prophetesse, and shee conceiued and bare a sonne, then
b.ISA.8.4	For before the childe shall haue knowledge to cry, My father and my mother,
b.ISA.8.5	The Lord spake also vnto me againe, saying,
b.ISA.8.6	For so much as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that goe softly, and
b.ISA.8.7	Now therefore behold, the Lord bringeth vp vpon them the waters of the riuer
b.ISA.8.8	And hee shall passe through Iudah, he shall ouerflow and goe ouer, he shall
b.ISA.8.9	Associate your selues, O ye people, and yee shalbe broken in pieces; and giue
b.ISA.9.1	Neuerthelesse the dimnesse shall not be such as was in her vexation; when at
b.ISA.9.10	The brickes are fallen downe, but we will build with hewen stones: the
b.ISA.9.11	Therefore the Lord shall set vp the aduersaries of Rezin against him, and
b.ISA.9.12	The Syrians before, and the Philistines behinde, and they shall deuoure
b.ISA.9.13	For the people turneth not vnto him that smiteth them, neither doe they seeke
b.ISA.9.14	Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and taile, branch and rush
b.ISA.9.15	The ancient and honourable, hee is the head: and the prophet that teacheth
b.ISA.9.16	For the leaders of this people cause them to erre, and they that are ledde of
b.ISA.9.17	Therfore the Lord shall haue no ioy in their yong men, neither shall haue
b.ISA.9.18	For wickednes burneth as the fire: it shall deuoure the briers and thornes,
b.ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people
b.ISA.9.2	The people that walked in darknesse, haue seene a great light: they that dwel
b.ISA.9.20	And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry, and he shall eate on
b.ISA.9.21	Manasseh, Ephraim: and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shalbe against
b.ISA.9.3	Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the ioy: they ioy before
b.ISA.9.4	For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staffe of his shoulder,
b.ISA.9.5	For euery battell of the warriour is with confused noise, and garments rolled
b.ISA.9.6	For vnto vs a child is borne, vnto vs a Sonne is giuen, and the gouernment
b.ISA.9.7	Of the increase of his gouernment and peace there shall be no end, vpon the
b.ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word into Iacob, and it hath lighted vpon Israel.
b.ISA.9.9	And all the people shal know, euen Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that
b.JAM.1.1	Iames a seruant of God, and of the Lord Iesus Christ, to the twelue Tribes which

b.JAM.1.11	For the Sunne is no sooner risen with a burning heate, but it withereth the
b.JAM.1.12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when hee is tried, hee shall
b.JAM.1.13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be
b.JAM.1.14	But euery man is tempted, when hee is drawen away of his owne lust, and
b.JAM.1.15	Then when lust hath conceiued, it bringeth forth sinne: and sinne, when it is
b.JAM.1.16	Doe not erre, my beloued brethren.
b.JAM.1.17	Euery good gift, and euery perfect gift is from aboue, &amp; commeth downe
b.JAM.1.18	Of his owne will begate hee vs, with the word of Trueth, that wee should bee
b.JAM.1.19	Wherefore my beloued brethren, let euery man bee swift to heare, slow to
b.JAM.1.2	My brethren, count it all ioy when ye fall into diuers temptations,
b.JAM.1.20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousnesse of God.
b.JAM.1.21	Wherefore lay apart all filthinesse, and superfluitie of naughtinesse, &amp;
b.JAM.1.22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers onely, receiuing your owne
b.JAM.1.23	For if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like vnto a man
b.JAM.1.24	For hee beholdeth himselfe, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth
b.JAM.1.25	But who so looketh into the perfect Law of libertie, and continueth therein,
b.JAM.1.26	If any man among you seeme to be religious, &amp; bridleth not his tongue,
b.JAM.1.27	Pure religion and vndefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the
b.JAM.1.3	Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience,
b.JAM.1.4	But let patience haue her perfect worke, that ye may be perfect, and entier,
b.JAM.1.5	If any of you lacke wisedome, let him aske of God, that giueth to all men
b.JAM.1.6	But let him aske in faith, nothing wauering: for he that wauereth is like a
b.JAM.1.7	For let not that man thinke that he shall receiue any thing of the Lord.
b.JAM.1.8	A double minded man is vnstable in all his wayes.
b.JAM.1.9	Let the brother of low degree, reioyce in that he is exalted:
b.JAM.2.1	My brethren, haue not the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ the Lord of glorie,
b.JAM.2.10	For whosoeuer shall keepe the whole Law, &amp; yet offend in one point, he is
b.JAM.2.11	For he that said, Doe not commit adultery; sayd also, Do not kill. Now if
b.JAM.2.12	So speake ye, and so doe, as they that shall bee iudged by the Law of
b.JAM.2.13	For he shall haue iudgement without mercie, that hath shewed no mercy, &amp;
b.JAM.2.14	What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say hee hath faith, and haue
b.JAM.2.15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of dayly foode,
b.JAM.2.16	And one of you say vnto them, Depart in peace, be you warmed &amp; filled:
b.JAM.2.17	Euen so faith, if it hath not works, is dead being alone.
b.JAM.2.18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I haue workes: shew mee thy faith
b.JAM.2.19	Thou beleeuest that there is one God, thou doest well: the deuils also
b.JAM.2.2	For if there come vnto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly
b.JAM.2.20	But wilt thou knowe, O vaine man, that faith without workes is dead?
b.JAM.2.21	Was not Abraham our father iustified by works, when hee had offered Isaac his
b.JAM.2.22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made
b.JAM.2.23	And the Scripture was fullfiled which saith, Abraham beleeued God, and it was
b.JAM.2.24	Ye see then, how that by workes a man is iustified, and not by faith only.
b.JAM.2.25	Likewise also, was not Rahab the harlot iustified by works, when she had
b.JAM.2.26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without workes is dead
b.JAM.2.3	And yee haue respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say vnto him,
b.JAM.2.4	Are yee not then partiall in your selues, and are become iudges of euill
b.JAM.2.5	Hearken, my beloued brethren, Hath not God chosen the poore of this world,
b.JAM.2.6	But yee haue despised the poore. Doe not rich men oppresse you, and draw you
b.JAM.2.7	Doe not they blaspheme that worthy Name, by the which ye are called?
b.JAM.2.8	If ye fulfil the royall Law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt loue thy
b.JAM.2.9	But if ye haue respect to persons, ye commit sinne, and are conuinced of the
b.JAM.3.1	My brethren, bee not many masters, knowing that we shall receiue the greater
b.JAM.3.10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing: my brethren, these
b.JAM.3.11	Doeth a fountaine send foorth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
b.JAM.3.12	Can ye figtree, my brethren, beare oliue berries? either a vine, figs? so can
b.JAM.3.13	Who is a wise man and indued with knowledge amongst you? let him shew out of
b.JAM.3.14	But if ye haue bitter enuying and strife in your hearts glory not, and lie
b.JAM.3.15	This wisedome descendeth not from aboue, but is earthly, sensuall, deuilish.
b.JAM.3.16	For where enuying and strife is, there is confusion, and euery euill worke.
b.JAM.3.17	But the wisedome that is from aboue, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,
b.JAM.3.18	And the fruit of righteousnesse is sowen in peace, of them that make peace.
b.JAM.3.2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a
b.JAM.3.3	Behold, we put bittes in the horses mouthes, that they may obey vs, and we
b.JAM.3.4	Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driuen of fierce
b.JAM.3.5	Euen so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things: behold, how
b.JAM.3.6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquitie: so is the tongue amongst our
b.JAM.3.7	For euery kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and things in the
b.JAM.3.8	But the tongue can no man tame, it is an vnruly euill, ful of deadly poyson.
b.JAM.3.9	Therewith blesse wee God, euen the Father: and therewith curse wee men, which
b.JAM.4.1	From whence come warres and fightings among you? come they not hence, euen of
b.JAM.4.10	Humble your selues in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you vp.
b.JAM.4.11	Speake not euill one of another (brethren:) he that speaketh euill of his
b.JAM.4.12	There is one Lawgiuer, who is able to saue, and to destroy: who art thou that
b.JAM.4.13	Goe to now ye that say, To day or to morrow wee will goe into such a city and
b.JAM.4.14	Whereas yee know not what shalbe on the morow: for what is your life? It is
b.JAM.4.15	For that yee ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall liue, and doe this, or
b.JAM.4.16	But now yee reioyce in your boastings: all such reioycing is euill.
b.JAM.4.17	Therefore to him that knoweth to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is
b.JAM.4.2	Ye lust, and haue not: yee kill, and desire to haue, and cannot obtaine: yee
b.JAM.4.3	Ye aske and receiue not, because ye aske amisse, that yee may consume it vpon
b.JAM.4.4	Ye adulterers, and adulteresses, know yee not that the friendship of the world
b.JAM.4.5	Doe ye thinke that the Scripture saith in vaine, the spirit that dwelleth in
b.JAM.4.6	But he giueth more grace, wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proude, but
b.JAM.4.7	Submit your selues therefore to God: resist the deuill, and hee will flee from
b.JAM.4.8	Draw nigh to God, and hee will draw nigh to you: cleanse your hands ye
b.JAM.4.9	Bee afflicted, and mourne, and weepe: let your laughter be turned to mourning,
b.JAM.5.1	Goe to now, yee rich men, weepe and howle for your miseries that shall come
b.JAM.5.10	Take, my brethren, the Prophets, who haue spoken in the Name of the Lord, for

b.JAM.5.14	Is any sicke among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let

b.JAM.5.16	Confesse your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that yee may

b.JAM.5.18	And hee prayed againe, and the heauen gaue raine, and the earth brought
b.JAM.5.19	Brethren, if any of you doe erre from the trueth, and one conuert him,
b.JAM.5.2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments motheaten:
b.JAM.5.20	Let him know, that hee which conuerteth the sinner from the errour of his
b.JAM.5.3	Your gold and siluer is cankered, and the rust of them shall bee a witnesse
b.JAM.5.4	Beholde, the hire of the labourers which haue reaped downe your fieldes, which
b.JAM.5.5	Yee haue liued in pleasure on the earth, and bene wanton: ye haue nourished
b.JAM.5.6	Yee haue condemned, and killed the iust, and he doth not resist you.
b.JAM.5.7	Be patient therefore, brethren, vnto the comming of the Lord: behold, the
b.JAM.5.8	Be yee also patient; stablish your hearts: for the comming of the Lorde
b.JAM.5.9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the
b.JDG.10.1	And after Abimelech, there arose to defend Israel, Tola the sonne of Puah, the
b.JDG.10.10	And the children of Israel cried vnto the Lord, saying, Wee haue sinned
b.JDG.10.11	And the Lord said vnto the children of Israel, Did not I deliuer you from the
b.JDG.10.12	The Zidonians also and the Amalekites, and the Maonites did oppresse you, and
b.JDG.10.13	Yet ye haue forsaken me, and serued other gods: wherefore I will deliuer you
b.JDG.10.14	Go, and cry vnto the gods which ye haue chosen, let them deliuer you in the
b.JDG.10.15	And the children of Israel said vnto the Lord, We haue sinned, doe thou vnto
b.JDG.10.16	And they put away the strange gods from among them, and serued the Lord: and
b.JDG.10.17	Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead:
b.JDG.10.18	And the people and Princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is hee
b.JDG.10.2	And he iudged Israel twenty and three yeeres, and died, and was buried in
b.JDG.10.3	And after him arose Iair a Gileadite, and iudged Israel twentie and two yeeres.
b.JDG.10.4	And hee had thirtie sonnes that rode on thirtie asse-colts, and they had
b.JDG.10.5	And Iair died, and was buried in Camon.
b.JDG.10.6	And the children of Israel did euill againe in the sight of the Lord, and
b.JDG.10.7	And the anger of the Lord was hot agaiust Israel, and hee solde them into the
b.JDG.10.8	And that yere they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteene
b.JDG.10.9	Moreouer, the children of Ammon passed ouer Iordan, to fight also against
b.JDG.1.1	Now after the death of Ioshua, it came to passe, that the children of Israel
b.JDG.1.10	And Iudah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (nowe the name of
b.JDG.1.11	And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir, (&amp; the name of
b.JDG.11.1	Now Iephthah the Gileadite was a mightie man of valour, and he was the sonne
b.JDG.11.10	And the Elders of Gilead said vnto Iephthah, The Lord be witnes betweene vs,
b.JDG.11.11	Then Iephthah went with the Elders of Gilead, and the people made him head
b.JDG.11.12	And Iephthah sent messengers vnto the king of the children of Ammon, saying,
b.JDG.11.13	And the king of the children of Ammon answered vnto the messengers of
b.JDG.11.14	And Iephthah sent messengers againe vnto the king of the children of Ammon:
b.JDG.11.15	And said vnto him, Thus saith Iephthah; Israel tooke not away the land of
b.JDG.11.16	But when Israel came vp from Egypt, and walked through the wildernesse, vnto
b.JDG.11.17	Then Israel sent messengers vnto the king of Edom saying, Let me, I pray
b.JDG.11.18	Then they went along through the wildernes, and compassed the land of Edom,
b.JDG.11.19	And Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of
b.JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, Hee that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I
b.JDG.11.2	And Gileads wife bare him sonnes, and his wiues sonnes grew vp, and they
b.JDG.11.20	But Sihon trusted not Israel, to passe through his coast: but Sihon gathered
b.JDG.11.21	And the Lord God of Israel deliuered Sihon and all his people into the hand
b.JDG.11.22	And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon euen vnto
b.JDG.11.23	So nowe the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his

b.JDG.11.25	And now, art thou any thing better then Balak the sonne of Zippor king of
b.JDG.11.26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon, and her townes, and in Aroer, and her townes,
b.JDG.11.27	Wherefore, I haue not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to warre
b.JDG.11.28	Howbeit, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not vnto the words of
b.JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Iephthah, and he passed ouer Gilead and
b.JDG.1.13	And Othniel the sonne of Kenaz Calebs yonger brother tooke it: and he gaue
b.JDG.11.3	Then Iephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there
b.JDG.11.30	And Iephthah vowed a vowe vnto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without
b.JDG.11.31	Then it shall be, that whatsoeuer commeth forth of the doores of my house to

b.JDG.11.33	And he smote them from Aroer, euen till thou come to Minnith, euen twentie
b.JDG.11.34	And Iephthah came to Mizpeh vnto his house, and beholde, his daughter came
b.JDG.11.35	And it came to passe when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said,
b.JDG.11.36	And she said vnto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth vnto the
b.JDG.11.37	And she said vnto her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two

b.JDG.11.39	And it came to passe at the ende of two moneths that shee returned vnto her
b.JDG.1.14	And it came to passe when shee came to him, that she moued him to aske of her
b.JDG.11.4	And it came to passe, in processe of time, that the children of Ammon made
b.JDG.11.40	That the daughters of Israel went yeerely to lament the daughter of Iephthah
b.JDG.1.15	And she said vnto him, Giue me a blessing: for thou hast giuen mee a South
b.JDG.11.5	And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the
b.JDG.1.16	And the children of the Kenite, Moses father in law, went vp out of the citie
b.JDG.11.6	And they said vnto Iephthah, Come and bee our Captaine, that wee may fight
b.JDG.1.17	And Iudah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that
b.JDG.11.7	And Iephthah said vnto the Elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expell me
b.JDG.1.18	Also Iudah tooke Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast
b.JDG.11.8	And the Elders of Gilead said vnto Iephthah, Therefore we turne againe to thee
b.JDG.1.19	And the Lord was with Iudah, and hee draue out the inhabitants of the
b.JDG.11.9	And Iephthah said vnto the Elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home againe to
b.JDG.1.2	And the Lord sayd, Iudah shall goe vp: Behold, I haue deliuered the land into
b.JDG.1.20	And they gaue Hebron vnto Caleb, as Moses saide: and hee expelled thence the
b.JDG.1.21	And the children of Beniamin did not driue out the Iebusites that inhabited
b.JDG.12.1	And the men of Ephraim gathered themselues together, and went Northward, &amp;
b.JDG.12.10	Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
b.JDG.12.11	And after him, Elon, a Zebulonite iudged Israel, and he iudged Israel ten

b.JDG.21.18	Howbeit wee may not giue them wiues of our daughters. For the children of
b.JDG.21.19	Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yerely, in a
b.JDG.2.12	And they forsooke the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of
b.JDG.21.2	And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till euen before God,
b.JDG.21.20	Therefore they commanded the children of Beniamin, saying, Goe and lie in
b.JDG.21.21	And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to daunce in daunces,
b.JDG.21.22	And it shall bee when their fathers or their brethren come vnto vs to
b.JDG.21.23	And the children of Beniamin did so, and tooke them wiues according to their
b.JDG.21.24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, euery man to his
b.JDG.21.25	In those dayes there was no King in Israel: euery man did that which was
b.JDG.2.13	And they forsooke the Lord, and serued Baal and Ashtaroth.
b.JDG.21.3	And said, O Lord God of Israel, why is this come to passe in Israel, that
b.JDG.2.14	And the anger of the Lord was hote against Israel, and he deliuered them into
b.JDG.21.4	And it came to passe on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built
b.JDG.2.15	Whither soeuer they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for euill,
b.JDG.21.5	And the children of Israel sayd, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel,
b.JDG.2.16	Neuerthelesse, the Lord raysed vp Iudges, which deliuered them out of the
b.JDG.21.6	And the children of Israel repented them for Beniamin their brother, and said,
b.JDG.2.17	And yet they would not hearken vnto their Iudges, but they went a whoring
b.JDG.21.7	How shall wee doe for wiues for them that remaine, seeing wee haue sworne by
b.JDG.2.18	And when the Lord raised them vp Iudges, then the Lord was with the Iudge,
b.JDG.21.8	And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel, that came not vp to
b.JDG.2.19	And it came to passe when the Iudge was dead, that they returned, and
b.JDG.21.9	For the people were numbred, and behold, there were none of the inhabitants of
b.JDG.2.2	And yee shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land, you shal throw
b.JDG.2.20	And the anger of the Lord was hote against Israel, and he said, Because that
b.JDG.2.21	I also will not henceforth driue out any from before them of the nations
b.JDG.2.22	That through them I may proue Israel, whether they will keepe the way of the
b.JDG.2.23	Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driuing them out hastily,
b.JDG.2.3	Wherefore I also said, I will not driue them out from before you: but they
b.JDG.2.4	And it came to passe when the Angel of the Lord spake these words vnto all the
b.JDG.2.5	And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there vnto
b.JDG.2.6	And when Ioshua had let the people goe, the children of Israel went euery man
b.JDG.2.7	And the people serued the Lord all the dayes of Ioshua, and all the dayes of
b.JDG.2.8	And Ioshua the sonne of Nun, the seruant of the Lord died, being an hundred
b.JDG.2.9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres, in the
b.JDG.3.1	Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prooue Israel by them, (euen
b.JDG.3.10	And the Spirit of the Lord came vpon him, and he iudged Israel, and went out
b.JDG.3.11	And the land had rest forty yeres: and Othniel the sonne of Kenaz died.
b.JDG.3.12	And the children of Israel did euill againe in the sight of the Lord: and the
b.JDG.3.13	And hee gathered vnto him the children of Ammon, and Amalek, and went and
b.JDG.3.14	So the children of Israel serued Eglon the King of Moab eighteene yeeres.
b.JDG.3.15	But when the children of Israel cried vnto the Lord, the Lord raised them vp
b.JDG.3.16	But Ehud made him a dagger (which had two edges) of a cubite length, and he
b.JDG.3.17	And he brought the present vnto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat
b.JDG.3.18	And when he had made an end to offer the Present, he sent away the people
b.JDG.3.19	But hee himselfe turned againe from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and
b.JDG.3.2	Onely that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them
b.JDG.3.20	And Ehud came vnto him, and he was sitting in a Summer parlour, which hee had
b.JDG.3.21	And Ehud put forth his left hand, and tooke the dagger from his right thigh,
b.JDG.3.22	And the haft also went in after the blade: and the fatte closed vpon the
b.JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went forth through the porche, and shut the doores of the parlour
b.JDG.3.24	When he was gone out, his seruants came, and when they saw, that behold, the
b.JDG.3.25	And they taried till they were ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doores
b.JDG.3.26	And Ehud escaped while they taried: and passed beyond the quarries, and
b.JDG.3.27	And it came to passe when hee was come, that hee blew a trumpet in the
b.JDG.3.28	And hee said vnto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath deliuered your
b.JDG.3.29	And they slewe of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and
b.JDG.3.3	Namely fiue lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the
b.JDG.3.30	So Moab was subdued that day vnder the hand of Israel: and the land had rest
b.JDG.3.31	And after him was Shamgar the sonne of Anath, which slew of the Philistines
b.JDG.3.4	And they were to prooue Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken
b.JDG.3.5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites,
b.JDG.3.6	And they tooke their daughters to be their wiues, and gaue their daughters to
b.JDG.3.7	And the children of Israel did euill in the sight of the Lord, and forgate the
b.JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the Lord was hote against Israel, and he sold them into
b.JDG.3.9	And when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord, the Lord raised vp a
b.JDG.4.1	And the children of Israel againe did euil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud
b.JDG.4.10	And Barak called Zebulun, and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went vp with ten
b.JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of
b.JDG.4.12	And they shewed Sisera, that Barak the sonne of Abinoam was gone vp to mount
b.JDG.4.13	And Sisera gathered together all his charets, euen nine hundred charets of
b.JDG.4.14	And Deborah said vnto Barak, Up, for this is the day in which the Lord hath
b.JDG.4.15	And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his charets, and all his hoste with
b.JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued after the charets, and after the hoste vnto Harosheth of
b.JDG.4.17	Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet, to the tent of Iael the wife of Heber
b.JDG.4.18	And Iael went out to meete Sisera, and said vnto him, Turne in, my lord,
b.JDG.4.19	And he said vnto her, Giue me, I pray thee, a litle water to drinke, for I am
b.JDG.4.2	And the Lord sold them into the hande of Iabin king of Canaan: that reigned in
b.JDG.4.20	Againe he said vnto her, Stand in the doore of the tent, and it shall bee
b.JDG.4.21	Then Iael Hebers wife, tooke a naile of the tent, and tooke an hammer in her
b.JDG.4.22	And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Iael came out to meet him, and said vnto
b.JDG.4.23	So God subdued on that day, Iabin the king of Canaan, before the children of
b.JDG.4.24	And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, &amp; preuailed against
b.JDG.4.3	And the children of Israel cried vnto the Lord: for he had nine hundred
b.JDG.4.4	And Deborah a prophetesse, the wife of Lapidoth, shee iudged Israel at that
b.JDG.4.5	And shee dwelt vnder the palme tree of Deborah, betweene Ramah and Bethel in
b.JDG.4.6	And shee sent and called Barak the sonne of Abinoam, out of Kedesh-Naphtali,
b.JDG.4.7	And I wil draw vnto thee to the riuer Kishon, Sisera the captaine of Iabins
b.JDG.4.8	And Barak said vnto her, If thou wilt goe with me, then I wil goe: but if thou
b.JDG.4.9	And she said, I wil surely go with thee, notwithstanding the iourney that thou
b.JDG.5.1	Then sang Deborah, and Barak the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,
b.JDG.5.10	Speake yee that ride on white asses, yee that sit in Iudgement, and walke by
b.JDG.5.11	They that are deliuered from the noise of Archers in the places of drawing
b.JDG.5.12	Awake, awake Deborah: awake, awake, vtter a song: arise Barak, and leade thy

b.JDG.5.14	Out of Ephraim was there a roote of them against Amalek, after thee Beniamin,
b.JDG.5.15	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah: euen Issachar, and also Barak,
b.JDG.5.16	Why abodest thou among the sheepefolds, to heare the bleatings of the flocks?
b.JDG.5.17	Gilead abode beyond Iordan: and why did Dan remaine in ships? Asher continued
b.JDG.5.18	Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that ieoparded their liues vnto the death,

b.JDG.5.20	They fought from heauen, the starres in their courses fought against Sisera.
b.JDG.5.21	The riuer of Kishon swept them away, that ancient riuer, the riuer Kishon: O

b.JDG.5.27	At her feete he bowed, he fell, he lay downe: at her feet he bowed, he fell;
b.JDG.5.28	The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattesse,
b.JDG.5.29	Her wise ladies answered her, yea she returned answere to her selfe,

b.JDG.5.7	The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, vntill that I
b.JDG.5.8	They chose new gods; then was warre in the gates: was there a shield or speare
b.JDG.5.9	My heart is toward the gouernours of Israel, that offered themselues willingly
b.JDG.6.1	And the children of Israel did euill in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord
b.JDG.6.10	And I said vnto you, I am the Lord your God, feare not the gods of the
b.JDG.6.11	And there came an Angel of the Lord, and sate vnder an Oake which was in

b.JDG.6.17	And he said vnto him, If now I haue found grace in thy sight, then shew me a
b.JDG.6.18	Depart not hence, I pray thee, vntil I come vnto thee, and bring forth my
b.JDG.6.19	And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and vnleauened cakes of an Ephah of
b.JDG.6.2	And the hand of Midian preuailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites,
b.JDG.6.20	And the Angel of God sayd vnto him, Take the flesh, and the vnleauened cakes,
b.JDG.6.21	Then the Angel of the Lord put foorth the end of the staffe that was in his
b.JDG.6.22	And when Gideon perceiued that hee was an Angel of the Lord, Gideon said,
b.JDG.6.23	And the Lord said vnto him, Peace be vnto thee, feare not, thou shalt not
b.JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an Altar there vnto the Lord, and called it Iehouah shalom:
b.JDG.6.25	And it came to passe the same night, that the Lord said vnto him, Take thy
b.JDG.6.26	And builde an Altar vnto the Lord thy God vpon the top of this rocke, in the
b.JDG.6.27	Then Gideon tooke ten men of his seruants, and did as the Lord had said vnto
b.JDG.6.28	And when the men of the citie arose earely in the morning, behold, the altar
b.JDG.6.29	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they
b.JDG.6.3	And so it was when Israel had sowen, that the Midianites came vp, &amp; the
b.JDG.6.30	Then the men of the citie said vnto Ioash, Bring out thy sonne, that he may

b.JDG.6.32	Therefore on that day hee called him Ierubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead
b.JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the East
b.JDG.6.34	But the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Gideon, and hee blewe a trumpet, and
b.JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also was gathered after
b.JDG.6.36	And Gideon said vnto God, If thou wilt saue Israel by mine hand, as thou hast
b.JDG.6.37	Beholde, I will put a fleece of wooll in the floore: and if the deaw be on
b.JDG.6.38	And it was so: for he rose vp early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece
b.JDG.6.39	And Gideon said vnto God, Let not thine anger be hote against me, and I will
b.JDG.6.4	And they encamped against them, and destroyed the encrease of the earth, till
b.JDG.6.40	And God did so that night: for it was drie vpon the fleece onely, and there
b.JDG.6.5	For they came vp with their cattell and their tents, and they came as
b.JDG.6.6	And Israel was greatly impouerished, because of the Midianites, and the
b.JDG.6.7	And it came to passe when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord, because
b.JDG.6.8	That the Lord sent a Prophet vnto the children of Israel, which said vnto
b.JDG.6.9	And I deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
b.JDG.7.1	Then Ierubbaal (who is Gideon) and all the people that were with him, rose vp
b.JDG.7.10	But if thou feare to goe downe, goe thou with Phurah thy seruant downe to the
b.JDG.7.11	And thou shalt heare what they say, and afterward shall thine handes be
b.JDG.7.12	And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the East, lay
b.JDG.7.13	And when Gideon was come, beholde, there was a man that tolde a dreame vnto
b.JDG.7.14	And his fellow answered, and said, This is nothing els saue the sword of
b.JDG.7.15	And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dreame, and the
b.JDG.7.16	And he diuided the three hundred men into three companies, and hee put a
b.JDG.7.17	And hee said vnto them, Looke on mee, and doe likewise; and beholde, when I
b.JDG.7.18	When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with mee, then blow ye the
b.JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men that were with him, came vnto the outside of
b.JDG.7.2	And the Lord said vnto Gideon, The people that are with thee, are too many for
b.JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held
b.JDG.7.21	And they stood euery man in his place, round about the campe: and all the
b.JDG.7.22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord set euery mans sword
b.JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel gathered themselues together out of Naphtali, and out
b.JDG.7.24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying; Come downe
b.JDG.7.25	And they tooke two Princes of the Midianites, Oreb, and Zeeb; and they slew
b.JDG.7.3	Now therefore go to, proclaime in the eares of the people, saying, Whosoeuer
b.JDG.7.4	And the Lord said vnto Gideon, The people are yet too many: bring them downe
b.JDG.7.5	So he brought downe the people vnto the water: and the Lord sayd vnto Gideon,
b.JDG.7.6	And the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth, were
b.JDG.7.7	And the Lord said vnto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped, will I
b.JDG.7.8	So the people tooke victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent
b.JDG.7.9	And it came to passe the same night, that the Lord sayd vnto him, Arise, get
b.JDG.8.1	And the men of Ephraim said vnto him, Why hast thou serued vs thus, that thou
b.JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hostes with them, about
b.JDG.8.11	And Gideon went vp by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the East of
b.JDG.8.12	And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two
b.JDG.8.13	And Gideon the sonne of Ioash returned from battel before the Sunne was vp,
b.JDG.8.14	And caught a yong man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he
b.JDG.8.15	And he came vnto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna,
b.JDG.8.16	And hee tooke the Elders of the citie, and thornes of the wildernes, and
b.JDG.8.17	And he beat downe the towre of Penuel, and slew the men of the citie.
b.JDG.8.18	Then said he vnto Zebah and Zalmunna, What maner of men were they whom ye

b.JDG.8.20	And he said vnto Iether his first borne, Up, and slay them: but the youth
b.JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall vpon vs: for as the man is,
b.JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel saide vnto Gideon, Rule thou ouer vs, both thou, and
b.JDG.8.23	And Gideon said vnto them, I will not rule ouer you, neither shall my sonne
b.JDG.8.24	And Gideon said vnto them, I would desire a request of you, that you would

b.JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden eare-rings that hee requested, was a thousand
b.JDG.8.27	And Gideon made an Ephod thereof, and put it in his citie, euen in Ophrah:
b.JDG.8.28	Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel; so that they lifted vp
b.JDG.8.29	And Ierubbaal the sonne of Ioash went &amp; dwelt in his owne house.
b.JDG.8.3	God hath deliuered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and
b.JDG.8.30	And Gideon had threescore and ten sonnes of his body begotten: for he had
b.JDG.8.31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, shee also bare him a sonne, whose name
b.JDG.8.32	And Gideon the sonne of Ioash died, in a good olde age, and was buried in the

b.JDG.8.4	And Gideon came to Iordan, and passed ouer, hee, and the three hundred men
b.JDG.8.5	And he said vnto the men of Succoth, Giue, I pray you, loaues of bread vnto
b.JDG.8.6	And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in
b.JDG.8.7	And Gideon said, Therfore when the Lord hath deliuered Zebah and Zalmunna into

b.JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the Figge tree, Come thou, and reigne ouer vs.
b.JDG.9.11	But the Figge tree saide vnto them, Should I forsake my sweetenesse, and my
b.JDG.9.12	Then saide the trees vnto the Uine, Come thou, and reigne ouer vs.
b.JDG.9.13	And the Uine said vnto them, Should I leaue my wine, which cheareth God and
b.JDG.9.14	Then said all the trees vnto the Bramble, Come thou, and reigne ouer vs.
b.JDG.9.15	And the Bramble said vnto the trees, If in trueth ye anoint me King ouer you,
b.JDG.9.16	Now therefore, if yee haue done truely and sincerely, in that yee haue made

b.JDG.9.20	But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and deuoure the men of Shechem
b.JDG.9.21	And Iotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there for feare of
b.JDG.9.22	When Abimelech had reigned three yeeres ouer Israel,
b.JDG.9.23	Then God sent an euill spirit betweene Abimelech &amp; the men of Shechem:
b.JDG.9.24	That the crueltie done to the threescore and ten sonnes of Ierubbaal might

b.JDG.9.27	And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode
b.JDG.9.28	And Gaal the sonne of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that

b.JDG.9.41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren,
b.JDG.9.42	And it came to passe on the morrow, that the people went out into the field,
b.JDG.9.43	And he tooke the people, and diuided them into three companies, and laide
b.JDG.9.44	And Abimelech, and the companie that was with him, rushed forward, and stood

b.JDG.9.47	And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the towre of Shechem were
b.JDG.9.48	And Abimelech gate him vp to mount Zalmon, hee and all the people that were
b.JDG.9.49	And all the people likewise cut downe euery man his bough, and followed
b.JDG.9.5	And hee went vnto his fathers house at Ophrah, and slewe his brethren the
b.JDG.9.50	Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and tooke it.
b.JDG.9.51	But there was a strong towre within the city, and thither fled all the men
b.JDG.9.52	And Abimelech came vnto the towre, and fought against it, and went hard vnto
b.JDG.9.53	And a certaine woman cast a piece of a milstone vpon Abimelechs head, and all
b.JDG.9.54	Then hee called hastily vnto the young man his armour-bearer, and said vnto
b.JDG.9.55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed euery
b.JDG.9.56	Thus God rendred the wickednesse of Abimelech which hee did vnto his father,
b.JDG.9.57	And all the euill of the men of Shechem, did God render vpon their heads: and
b.JDG.9.6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and
b.JDG.9.7	And when they told it to Iotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim,
b.JDG.9.8	The trees went foorth on a time to annoint a King ouer them, and they said
b.JDG.9.9	But the Oliue tree saide vnto them, Should I leaue my fatnesse, wherewith by
b.JER.10.1	Heare ye the word which the Lord speaketh vnto you, O house of Israel.
b.JER.10.10	But the Lord is the true God, he is the liuing God, and an euerlasting King:
b.JER.10.11	Thus shal ye say vnto them, The Gods that haue not made the heauens, &amp;
b.JER.10.12	Hee hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his
b.JER.10.13	When he vttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heauens,
b.JER.10.14	Euery man is brutish in his knowledge, euery founder is confounded by the
b.JER.10.15	They are vanity, and the worke of errours: in the time of their visitation
b.JER.10.16	The portion of Iacob is not like them: for he is the fourmer of all things,
b.JER.10.17	Gather vp thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortresse.
b.JER.10.18	For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land
b.JER.10.19	Woe is mee for my hurt, my wound is grieuous: but I sayd, Truely this is a
b.JER.10.2	Thus sayeth the Lord, Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed
b.JER.10.20	My Tabernacle is spoyled, and all my cordes are broken: my children are gone
b.JER.10.21	For the Pastours are become brutish, and haue not sought the Lord: therefore
b.JER.10.22	Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the
b.JER.10.23	O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himselfe: it is not in man that
b.JER.10.24	O Lord, correct mee, but with iudgement, not in thine anger, lest thou bring
b.JER.10.25	Powre out thy fury vpon the heathen that know thee not, and vpon the families
b.JER.10.3	For the customes of the people are vaine: for one cutteth a tree out of the
b.JER.10.4	They decke it with siluer and with golde, they fasten it with nayles, and with
b.JER.10.5	They are vpright as the palme tree, but speake not: they must needes bee
b.JER.10.6	Forasmuch as there is none like vnto thee, O Lord, thou art great, and thy
b.JER.10.7	Who would not feare thee, O King of nations? for to thee doeth it appertaine:
b.JER.10.8	But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stocke is a doctrine of
b.JER.10.9	Siluer spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the
b.JER.1.1	The wordes of Ieremiah the sonne of Hilkiah, of the Priests that were in
b.JER.1.10	See, I haue this day set thee ouer the nations, and ouer the kingdomes, to
b.JER.1.11	Moreouer, the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying; Ieremiah, what seest
b.JER.11.1	The word that came to Ieremiah from the Lord, saying,
b.JER.11.10	They are turned backe to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused
b.JER.11.11	Therefore thus sayeth the Lord, Behold, I will bring euill vpon them which
b.JER.11.12	Then shall the cities of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem goe, and crie
b.JER.11.13	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Iudah, and
b.JER.11.14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift vp a cry or prayer for
b.JER.11.15	What hath my beloued to doe in mine house, seeing shee hath wrought lewdnesse
b.JER.11.16	The Lord called thy name, A greene oliue tree, faire and of goodly fruite:
b.JER.11.17	For the Lord of hostes that planted thee, hath pronounced euill against thee,
b.JER.11.18	And the Lord hath giuen mee knowledge of it, and I knowe it, then thou
b.JER.11.19	But I was like a lambe or an oxe that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew
b.JER.1.12	Then said the Lord vnto me, Thou hast well seene: for I will hasten my word
b.JER.11.2	Heare yee the words of this Couenant, and speake vnto the men of Iudah, and to
b.JER.11.20	But, O Lord of hostes, that iudgest righteously, that tryest the reines, and
b.JER.11.21	Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth, that seeke thy life,
b.JER.11.22	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I wil punish them: the young
b.JER.11.23	And there shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring euill vpon the men of
b.JER.1.13	And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee the second time, saying; What seest
b.JER.11.3	And say thou vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Cursed bee the man
b.JER.1.14	Then the Lord said vnto me; Out of the North an euill shal breake foorth vpon
b.JER.11.4	Which I commaunded your fathers in the day that I brought them foorth out of
b.JER.1.15	For loe, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the North, saith the
b.JER.11.5	That I may performe the othe which I haue sworne vnto your fathers, to giue
b.JER.1.16	And I will vtter my iudgements against them touching all their wickednesse,
b.JER.11.6	Then the Lord said vnto me, Proclaime all these wordes in the cities of Iudah,
b.JER.1.17	Thou therefore gird vp thy loynes, and arise and speake vnto them all that I
b.JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested vnto your fathers, in the day that I brought them vp
b.JER.1.18	For behold, I haue made thee this day a defenced citie, and an yron pillar,
b.JER.11.8	Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their eare: but walked euery one in the
b.JER.1.19	And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not preuaile against thee:
b.JER.11.9	And the Lord said vnto me, A conspiracie is found among the men of Iudah, and
b.JER.1.2	To whom the word of the Lord came in the dayes of Iosiah the sonne of Amon
b.JER.12.1	Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I pleade with thee: yet let mee talke with
b.JER.12.10	Many pastors haue destroyed my vineyard; they haue troden my portion vnder
b.JER.12.11	They haue made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth vnto me; the whole
b.JER.12.12	The spoilers are come vpon all high places through the wildernesse: for the
b.JER.12.13	They haue sowen wheate, but shall reape thornes: they haue put themselues to
b.JER.12.14	Thus saith the Lord against all mine euill neighbours, that touch the
b.JER.12.15	And it shall come to passe after that I haue plucked them out, I will returne,
b.JER.12.16	And it shall come to passe, if they will diligently learne the wayes of my
b.JER.12.17	But if they will not obey, I will vtterly plucke vp, and destroy that nation,
b.JER.12.2	Thou hast planted them, yea they haue taken root: they grow, yea they bring
b.JER.12.3	But thou, O Lord, knowest me; thou hast seene me, and tried mine heart towards
b.JER.12.4	How long shall the land mourne, and the herbes of euery field wither, for the
b.JER.12.5	If thou hast runne with the footmen, and they haue wearied thee, then how
b.JER.12.6	For euen thy brethren and the house of thy father, euen they haue dealt
b.JER.12.7	I haue forsaken mine house: I haue left mine heritage: I haue giuen the
b.JER.12.8	Mine heritage is vnto me as a lyon in the forrest: it cryeth out against me,
b.JER.12.9	Mine heritage is vnto mee as a speckled bird, the birdes round about are
b.JER.1.3	It came also in the dayes of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, vnto
b.JER.13.1	Thus saith the Lord vnto me; Goe and get thee a linen girdle, and put it vpon
b.JER.13.10	This euill people which refuse to heare my words, which walke in the
b.JER.13.11	For as the girdle cleaueth to the loines of a man: so haue I caused to cleaue
b.JER.13.12	Therefore thou shalt speake vnto them this word; Thus saith the Lord God of
b.JER.13.13	Then shalt thou say vnto them; Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will fill all
b.JER.13.14	And I will dash them one against another, euen the fathers and the sonnes
b.JER.13.15	Heare ye and giue eare, bee not proud: for the Lord hath spoken.
b.JER.13.16	Giue glory to the Lord your God before he cause darknesse, and before your
b.JER.13.17	But if ye will not heare it, my soule shall weepe in secret places for your
b.JER.13.18	Say vnto the king, and to the queene, Humble your selues, sit downe, for your
b.JER.13.19	The cities of the South shall bee shut vp, and none shall open them, Iudah
b.JER.13.2	So I got a girdle, according to the word of the Lord, and put it on my loines.
b.JER.13.20	Lift vp your eyes, and beholde them that come from the North, where is the
b.JER.13.21	What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee (for thou hast taught them to be
b.JER.13.22	And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things vpon me? for the
b.JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skinne? or the leopard his spots? then may ye
b.JER.13.24	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the winde
b.JER.13.26	Therefore will I discouer thy skirts vpon thy face, that thy shame may
b.JER.13.27	I haue seene thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdnesse of thy
b.JER.13.3	And the word of the Lord came vnto me the second time, saying;
b.JER.13.4	Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is vpon thy loines, and arise, goe
b.JER.13.5	So I went and hid it by Euphrates, as the Lord commaunded mee.
b.JER.13.6	And it came to passe after many daies, that the Lord saide vnto me; Arise, goe
b.JER.13.7	Then I went to Euphrates and digged, and tooke the girdle from the place where
b.JER.13.8	Then the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.JER.13.9	Thus saith the Lord; After this maner will I marre the pride of Iudah, and the
b.JER.1.4	Then the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.JER.14.1	The word of the Lord that came to Ieremiah concerning the dearth.
b.JER.14.10	Thus saith the Lord vnto this people, Thus haue they loued to wander, they
b.JER.14.11	Then said the Lord vnto mee, Pray not for this people, for their good.
b.JER.14.12	When they fast I will not heare their crie, and when they offer burnt
b.JER.14.13	Then said I Ah Lord God, behold, the prophets say vnto them; Ye shall not see
b.JER.14.14	Then the Lord said vnto me, The prophets prophecie lies in my Name, I sent
b.JER.14.15	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophecie in my
b.JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophecie, shall be cast out in the streets of
b.JER.14.17	Therefore thou shalt say this word vnto them, Let mine eies runne downe with
b.JER.14.18	If I goe forth into the field, then behold the slaine with the sword, and if
b.JER.14.19	Hast thou vtterly reiected Iudah? hath thy soule loathed Zion? why hast thou
b.JER.14.2	Iudah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they are blacke vnto the
b.JER.14.20	We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickednes, and the iniquitie of our fathers: for
b.JER.14.21	Do not abhorre vs, for thy Names sake, doe not disgrace the Throne of thy
b.JER.14.22	Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause raine? or can
b.JER.14.3	And their nobles haue sent their litle ones to the waters, they came to the
b.JER.14.4	Because the ground is chapt, for there was no raine in the earth, the plowmen
b.JER.14.5	Yea the hinde also calued in the field, and forsooke it, because there was no
b.JER.14.6	And the wilde asses did stand in the hie places, they snuffed vp the winde
b.JER.14.7	O Lord, though our iniquities testifie against vs, doe thou it for thy Names
b.JER.14.8	O the hope of Israel, the Sauiour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest
b.JER.14.9	Why shouldest thou bee as a man astonied, as a mightie man that cannot saue?
b.JER.1.5	Before I formed thee in the bellie, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth
b.JER.15.1	Then said the Lord vnto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my
b.JER.15.10	Woe is mee, my mother, that that thou hast borne me a man of strife, and a
b.JER.15.11	The Lord said, Uerely it shall be well with thy remnant, verely I will cause
b.JER.15.12	Shall yron breake the Northren yron, and the steele?
b.JER.15.13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I giue to the spoile without price, and
b.JER.15.14	And I will make thee to passe with thine enemies, into a land which thou
b.JER.15.15	O Lord, thou knowest, remember me, and visit me, and reuenge me of my
b.JER.15.16	Thy wordes were found, and I did eate them, and thy word was vnto mee, the
b.JER.15.17	I sate not in the assembly of the mockers, nor reioyced: I sate alone because
b.JER.15.18	Why is my paine perpetuall? and my wound incurable which refuseth to be
b.JER.15.19	Therfore thus saith the Lord; If thou returne, then will I bring thee againe,
b.JER.15.2	And it shall come to passe if they say vnto thee, Whither shall wee goe foorth?
b.JER.15.20	And I will make thee vnto this people a fenced brasen wall, and they shall
b.JER.15.21	And I will deliuer thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeeme
b.JER.15.3	And I will appoint ouer them foure kindes, saith the Lord, the sword to slay,
b.JER.15.4	And I will cause them to be remoued into all kingdomes of the earth, because
b.JER.15.5	For who shall haue pitie vpon thee, O Ierusalem? or who shall bemoane thee? or
b.JER.15.6	Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore will
b.JER.15.7	And I will fanne them with a fanne in the gates of the land: I will bereaue
b.JER.15.8	Their widowes are increased to me aboue the sand of the seas: I haue brought
b.JER.15.9	She that hath borne seuen, languisheth: she hath giuen vp the ghost: her sunne
b.JER.1.6	Then said I, Ah Lord God, behold, I cannot speake, for I am a childe.
b.JER.16.1	The word of the Lord came also vnto me, saying;
b.JER.16.10	And it shal come to passe when thou shalt shewe this people all these wordes,
b.JER.16.11	Then shalt thou say vnto them; Because your fathers haue forsaken me, saith
b.JER.16.12	And yee haue done worse then your fathers, (for behold, yee walke euerie one
b.JER.16.13	Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that yee knowe not,
b.JER.16.14	Therefore behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be
b.JER.16.15	But, The Lord liueth, that brought vp the children of Israel from the land of
b.JER.16.16	Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shal fish
b.JER.16.17	For mine eyes are vpon all their waies: they are not hid from my face,
b.JER.16.18	And first I will recompense their iniquitie, and their sinne double, because
b.JER.16.19	O Lord, my strength and my fortresse, and my refuge in the day of affliction;
b.JER.16.2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou haue sonnes nor daughters
b.JER.16.20	Shall a man make Gods vnto himselfe, and they are no Gods?
b.JER.16.21	Therefore behold, I will this once cause them to know: I will cause them to
b.JER.16.3	For thus sayth the Lord concerning the sonnes and concerning the daughters
b.JER.16.4	They shal die of grieuous deaths, they shall not bee lamented, neither shall
b.JER.16.5	For thus sayth the Lord, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither goe to
b.JER.16.6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried,
b.JER.16.7	Neither shall men teare themselues for them in mourning to comfort them for
b.JER.16.8	Thou shalt not also goe into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat
b.JER.16.9	For thus sayth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to
b.JER.1.7	But the Lord sayd vnto me, Say not, I am a childe: for thou shalt goe to all
b.JER.17.1	The sinne of Iudah is written with a pen of yron, and with the point of a
b.JER.17.10	I the Lord search the heart, I try the reines, euen to giue euery man
b.JER.17.11	As the partrich sitteth on egges, and hatcheth them not: so he that getteth
b.JER.17.12	A glorious high throne from the beginning, is the place of our Sanctuarie.
b.JER.17.13	O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they
b.JER.17.14	Heale me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: saue me, and I shalbe saued: for
b.JER.17.15	Behold, they say vnto mee, Where is the word of the Lord ? let it come now.
b.JER.17.16	As for me, I haue not hastened from being a pastour to follow thee, neither
b.JER.17.17	Be not a terrour vnto me, thou art my hope in the day of euill.
b.JER.17.18	Let them bee confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let
b.JER.17.19	Thus sayd the Lord vnto me, Go and stand in the gate of the children of the
b.JER.17.2	Whilest their children remember their altars and their groues by the greene
b.JER.17.20	And say vnto them, Heare ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Iudah, and all
b.JER.17.21	Thus saith the Lord, Take heed to your selues, and beare no burden on the
b.JER.17.22	Neither carie forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, neither
b.JER.17.23	But they obeyed not, neither inclined their eare, but made their necke stiffe,
b.JER.17.24	And it shall come to passe, if yee diligently hearken vnto me, saith the
b.JER.17.25	Then shall there enter into the gates of this citie kings and princes sitting
b.JER.17.26	And they shall come from the cities of Iudah, and from the places about
b.JER.17.27	But if you will not hearken vnto me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to
b.JER.17.3	O my mountaine, in the field I will giue thy substance, and all thy treasures
b.JER.17.4	And thou, euen thy selfe shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gaue
b.JER.17.5	Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh
b.JER.17.6	For hee shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good
b.JER.17.7	Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.
b.JER.17.8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her
b.JER.17.9	The heart is deceitfull aboue all things, and desperately wicked, who can know
b.JER.1.8	Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliuer thee, sayth the
b.JER.18.1	The word which came to Ieremiah from ye Lord saying,
b.JER.18.10	If it doe euill in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of
b.JER.18.11	Now therefore goe to, speake to the men of Iudah, and to the inhabitants of
b.JER.18.12	And they said, There is no hope, but wee will walke after our owne deuices,
b.JER.18.13	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Aske ye now among the heathen, who hath heard
b.JER.18.14	Will a man leaue the snow of Lebanon which commeth from the rocke of the
b.JER.18.15	Because my people hath forgotten mee, they haue burnt incense to vanitie, and
b.JER.18.16	To make their land desolate and a perpetuall hissing: euery one that passeth
b.JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an East winde before the enemie: I will shew them
b.JER.18.18	Then said they, Come, and let vs deuise deuices against Ieremiah: for the Law
b.JER.18.19	Giue heed to me, O Lord, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with
b.JER.18.2	Arise and go downe to the potters house, &amp; there I will cause thee to
b.JER.18.20	Shall euill bee recompensed for good? for they haue digged a pit for my soule:
b.JER.18.21	Therefore deliuer vp their children to the famine, and powre out their blood
b.JER.18.22	Let a crie bee heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troupe
b.JER.18.23	Yet Lord thou knowest all their counsell against me to slay mee: forgiue not
b.JER.18.3	Then I went downe to the potters house, and behold, hee wrought a worke on the
b.JER.18.4	And the vessell that he made of clay, was marred in the hand of the potter; so
b.JER.18.5	Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
b.JER.18.6	O house of Israel, cannot I doe with you as this potter, saith the Lord ?
b.JER.18.7	At what instant I shall speake concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome,
b.JER.18.8	If that nation against whom I haue pronounced, turne from their euill, I will
b.JER.18.9	And at what instant I shall speake concerning a nation, and concerning a
b.JER.1.9	Then the Lord put foorth his hand, and touched my mouth, and the Lord said
b.JER.19.1	Thus saith the Lord, Goe and get a potters earthen bottell, and take of the
b.JER.19.10	Then shalt thou breake ye bottle in the sight of the men that goe with thee,
b.JER.19.11	And shalt say vnto them; Thus saith the Lord of hostes, Euen so will I breake
b.JER.19.12	Thus will I doe vnto this place, sayth the Lord, and to the inhabitants
b.JER.19.13	And the houses of Ierusalem, and the houses of the kings of Iudah shall bee
b.JER.19.14	Then came Ieremiah from Tophet, whither the Lord had sent him to prophecie,
b.JER.19.15	Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, Behold, I wil bring vpon
b.JER.19.2	And goe forth vnto the valley of the sonne of Hinnom, which is by the entrie
b.JER.19.3	And say, Heare ye the word of the Lord, O kings of Iudah, and inhabitants of
b.JER.19.4	Because they haue forsaken mee, and haue estranged this place, and haue burnt
b.JER.19.5	They haue built also the high places of Baal, to burne their sonnes with fire
b.JER.19.6	Therefore behold, the daies come, saith the Lord, that this place shall no
b.JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsell of Iudah and Ierusalem in this place, and I
b.JER.19.8	And I will make this citie desolate and an hissing: euery one that passeth
b.JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eate the flesh of their sonnes and the flesh of their
b.JER.20.1	Now Pashur the sonne of Immer the Priest, who was also chiefe gouernor in the
b.JER.20.10	For I heard the defaming of many, feare on euery side. Report, say they, and
b.JER.20.11	But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutours
b.JER.20.12	But O Lord of hostes, that tryest the righteous, and seest the reines and the
b.JER.20.13	Sing vnto the Lord, praise yee the Lord: for hee hath deliuered the soule of
b.JER.20.14	Cursed be the day wherein I was borne: let not the day wherein my mother bare
b.JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying: A man child is
b.JER.20.16	And let that man be as the cities which the Lord ouerthrew and repented not:
b.JER.20.17	Because he slew me not from the wombe: or that my mother might haue beene my
b.JER.20.18	Wherefore came I forth out of the wombe to see labour and sorrow, that my
b.JER.20.2	Then Pashur smote Ieremiah the Prophet, and put him in the stockes that were
b.JER.20.3	And it came to passe on the morrow, that Pashur brought foorth Ieremiah out of
b.JER.20.4	For thus sayth the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terrour to thy selfe, and
b.JER.20.5	Moreouer, I will deliuer all the strength of this city, and all the labours
b.JER.20.6	And thou Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house, shall goe into captiuitie,
b.JER.20.7	O Lord, thou hast deceiued me, and I was deceiued, thou art stronger then I,
b.JER.20.8	For since I spake I cryed out, I cried violence and spoyle; because the word
b.JER.20.9	Then I said; I will not make mention of him, nor speake any more in his name.
b.JER.2.1	Moreouer, the word of the Lord came to me, saying;
b.JER.2.10	For passe ouer the yles of Chittim, and see; and send vnto Kedar and consider
b.JER.2.11	Hath a nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods? but my people haue
b.JER.21.1	The word which came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord, when king Zedekiah sent vnto
b.JER.21.10	For I haue set my face against this citie for euill and not for good, saith
b.JER.21.11	And touching the house of the king of Iudah, say; Heare yee the word of the
b.JER.21.12	Oh house of Dauid, thus saith the Lord, Execute iudgement in the morning, and
b.JER.21.13	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rocke of the
b.JER.21.14	But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the Lord:
b.JER.2.12	Be astonished, O yee heauens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be yee very
b.JER.21.2	Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for vs (for Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon
b.JER.2.13	For my people haue committed two euils: they haue forsaken me, the fountaine
b.JER.21.3	Then saide Ieremiah vnto them. Thus shall yee say to Zedekiah,
b.JER.2.14	Is Israel a seruant? is he a home-borne slaue? why is he spoiled?
b.JER.21.4	Thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I will turne backe the weapons of
b.JER.2.15	The young lyons roared vpon him and yelled, and they made his land waste: his
b.JER.21.5	And I myselfe will fight against you with an out stretched hand, and with a
b.JER.2.16	Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes haue broken the crowne of thy head.
b.JER.21.6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this citie both man and beast: they shall
b.JER.2.17	Hast thou not procured this vnto thy selfe, in that thou hast forsaken the
b.JER.21.7	And afterward, saith the Lord, I will deliuer Zedekiah king of Iudah, and his
b.JER.2.18	And now what hast thou to doe in the way of Egypt, to drinke the waters of
b.JER.21.8	And vnto this people thou shalt say; Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I set before
b.JER.2.19	Thine owne wickednesse shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reproue
b.JER.21.9	He that abideth in this citie, shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and
b.JER.2.2	Goe, and crie in the eares of Ierusalem, saying; Thus sayth the Lord, I
b.JER.2.20	For of old time I haue broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands, and thou saidst;
b.JER.2.21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholy a right seede: How then art thou
b.JER.22.1	Thus saith the Lord, Goe downe to the house of the king of Iudah, and speake
b.JER.22.10	Weepe ye not for the dead, neither bemoane him, but weepe sore for him that
b.JER.22.11	For thus saith the Lord touching Shallum, the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah
b.JER.22.12	But he shall die in the place whither they haue led him captiue, and shal see
b.JER.22.13	Woe vnto him that buildeth his house by vnrighteousnesse, and his chambers by
b.JER.22.14	That saith, I will build mee a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him
b.JER.22.15	Shalt thou reigne because thou closest thy selfe in cedar? did not thy father
b.JER.22.16	He iudged the cause of the poore and needy, then it was well with him: was
b.JER.22.17	But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy couetousnesse, and for to
b.JER.22.18	Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king
b.JER.22.19	He shall be buried with the buriall of an asse, drawen and cast forth beyond
b.JER.2.22	For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, yet thine
b.JER.22.2	And say, Heare the word of the Lord, O king of Iudah, that sittest vpon the
b.JER.22.20	Goe vp to Lebanon, and crie, and lift vp thy voice in Bashan, and crie from
b.JER.22.21	I spake vnto thee in thy prosperitie, but thou saidest, I will not heare:
b.JER.22.22	The winde shall eate vp all thy pastors, and thy louers shall goe into
b.JER.22.23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the Cedars, how gracious
b.JER.22.24	As I liue, saith the Lord, though Coniah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of Iudah
b.JER.22.25	And I will giue thee into the hand of them that seeke thy life, and into the
b.JER.22.26	And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another
b.JER.22.27	But to the land whereunto they desire to returne, thither shall they not
b.JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken idole? is hee a vessell wherein is no
b.JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord:
b.JER.2.23	How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I haue not gone after Baalim? see thy
b.JER.22.3	Thus saith the Lord, Execute ye iudgement and righteousnesse, and deliuer the
b.JER.22.30	Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man childlesse, a man that shall not
b.JER.2.24	A wild asse vsed to the wildernesse, that snuffeth vp the wind at her
b.JER.22.4	For if ye doe this thing indeede, then shall there enter in by the gates of
b.JER.2.25	Withhold thy foote from being vnshod, and thy throte from thirst: but thou
b.JER.22.5	But if yee will not heare these words, I sweare by my selfe, saith the Lord,
b.JER.2.26	As the thiefe is ashamed, when he is found: so is the house of Israel
b.JER.22.6	For thus saith the Lord vnto the kings house of Iudah, Thou art Gilead vnto
b.JER.2.27	Saying to a stocke; Thou art my father, and to a stone; Thou hast brought me
b.JER.22.7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee, euery one with his weapons, and
b.JER.2.28	But where are thy Gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise if they can
b.JER.22.8	And many nations shall passe by this citie, and they shall say euery man to
b.JER.2.29	Wherefore will yee plead with me? yee all haue transgressed against me, saith
b.JER.22.9	Then they shall answere, Because they haue forsaken the couenant of the Lord
b.JER.2.3	Israel was holinesse vnto the Lord, and the first fruites of his increase: all
b.JER.2.30	In vaine haue I smitten your children, they receiued no correction: your owne
b.JER.2.31	O generation, see yee the word of the Lord: haue I beene a wildernesse vnto
b.JER.23.1	Woe bee vnto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheepe of my pasture,
b.JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers, for because of swearing the land mourneth:
b.JER.23.11	For both prophet and priest are prophane, yea in my house haue I found their
b.JER.23.12	Wherefore their way shalbe vnto them as slippery wayes in the darkenes: they
b.JER.23.13	And I haue seene folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophecied in Baal,
b.JER.23.14	I haue seene also in the prophets of Ierusalem an horrible thing: they commit
b.JER.23.15	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the Prophets; Behold, I
b.JER.23.16	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not vnto the wordes of the prophets
b.JER.23.17	They say still vnto them that despise me; The Lord hath sayde, Yee shall haue
b.JER.23.18	For who hath stood in the counsell of the Lord, and hath perceiued, and heard
b.JER.23.19	Behold, a whirlewinde of the Lord is gone foorth in furie, euen a grieuous
b.JER.2.32	Can a maide forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people haue
b.JER.23.2	Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my
b.JER.23.20	The anger of the Lord shall not returne, vntill hee haue executed, and til he
b.JER.23.21	I haue not sent these prophets, yet they ranne: I haue not spoken to them,
b.JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my counsell, and had caused my people to heare my
b.JER.23.23	Am I a God at hand, sayth the Lord, and not a God afarre off?
b.JER.23.24	Can any hide himselfe in secret places that I shall not see him, saith the
b.JER.23.25	I haue heard what the prophets said, that prophecie lyes in my Name, saying;
b.JER.23.26	How long shall this bee in the heart of the prophets that prophecie lies? yea
b.JER.23.27	Which thinke to cause my people to forget my Name by their dreames which they
b.JER.23.28	The prophet that hath a dreame, let him tell a dreame; and hee that hath my
b.JER.23.29	Is not my word like as a fire, saith the Lord ? and like a hammer that
b.JER.2.33	Why trimmest thou thy way to seeke loue? therefore hast thou also taught the
b.JER.23.3	And I wil gather the remnant of my flocke, out of all countreis whither I haue
b.JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, sayth the Lord, that steale my
b.JER.23.31	Beholde, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that vse their tongues,
b.JER.23.32	Behold, I am against them that prophecie false dreames, sayeth the Lord, and
b.JER.23.33	And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest shall aske thee, saying;
b.JER.23.34	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people that shal say, The
b.JER.23.35	Thus shall yee say euery one to his neighbour, and euery one to his brother,
b.JER.23.36	And the burden of the Lord shall yee mention no more: for euery mans word
b.JER.23.37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and
b.JER.23.38	But sith ye say, The burden of the Lord; therefore thus sayeth the Lord,
b.JER.23.39	Therefore beholde, I, euen I will vtterly forget you, and I will forsake you,
b.JER.2.34	Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the soules of the poore innocents: I
b.JER.23.4	And I will set vp shepheards ouer them which shall feed them, and they shal
b.JER.23.40	And I will bring an euerlasting reproch vpon you, and a perpetuall shame,
b.JER.2.35	Yet thou sayest; Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turne from me:
b.JER.23.5	Behold, the daies come, saith the Lord, that I wil raise vnto Dauid a
b.JER.2.36	Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt bee ashamed
b.JER.23.6	In his dayes Iudah shalbe saued, and Israel shall dwell safely, and this is
b.JER.2.37	Yea thou shalt goe forth from him, and thine hands vpon thine head: for the
b.JER.23.7	Therefore behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say;
b.JER.23.8	But, The Lord liueth, which brought vp, and which led the seed of the house of
b.JER.23.9	Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets, all my bones shake: I
b.JER.2.4	Heare ye the word of the Lord, O house of Iacob, and all the families of the
b.JER.24.1	The Lord shewed mee, and behold, two baskets of figges were set before the
b.JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till
b.JER.24.2	One basket had very good figges, euen like the figges that are first ripe: and
b.JER.24.3	Then said the Lord vnto me; What seest thou Ieremiah? and I said: Figges: the
b.JER.24.4	Againe, the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.JER.24.5	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Like these good figges, so will I
b.JER.24.6	For I will set mine eyes vpon them for good, and I will bring them againe to
b.JER.24.7	And I will giue them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they shall
b.JER.24.8	And as the euill figges which cannot be eaten, they are so euill; (Surely thus
b.JER.24.9	And I will deliuer them to be remoued into all the kingdomes of the earth for
b.JER.2.5	Thus sayth the Lord, What iniquitie haue your fathers found in me, that they
b.JER.25.1	The word that came to Ieremiah concerning all the people of Iudah, in the
b.JER.25.10	Moreouer, I will take from them the voyce of myrth, and the voice of gladnes,
b.JER.25.11	And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment, and these
b.JER.25.12	And it shall come to passe when seuentie yeeres are accomplished, that I will
b.JER.25.13	And I will bring vpon that land all my words which I haue pronounced against
b.JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings shall serue themselues of them also: and I
b.JER.25.15	For thus saith the Lord God of Israel vnto me, Take the wine cup of this
b.JER.25.16	And they shall drinke, and be moued, and be mad, because of the sworde that I
b.JER.25.17	Then tooke I the cuppe at the Lords hand, and made all the nations to drinke,
b.JER.25.18	To wit Ierusalem, and the cities of Iudah, and the kings thereof, and the
b.JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his seruants, and his princes, and all his people:
b.JER.25.2	The which Ieremiah the prophet spake vnto all the people of Iudah, and to all
b.JER.25.20	And all the mingled people, &amp; all the kings of the land of Uz: and all
b.JER.25.21	Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon:
b.JER.25.22	And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the
b.JER.25.23	Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the vtmost corners:
b.JER.25.24	And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that
b.JER.25.25	And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of
b.JER.25.26	And all the kings of the North, farre and neere, one with another, and all
b.JER.25.27	Therefore thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of
b.JER.25.28	And it shall bee, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drinke,
b.JER.25.29	For loe, I begin to bring euill on the citie, which is called by my name, and
b.JER.25.3	From the thirteenth yere of Iosiah the sonne of Amon king of Iudah, euen vnto
b.JER.25.30	Therefore prophecie thou against them all these wordes, and say vnto them,
b.JER.25.31	A noise shall come euen to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a
b.JER.25.32	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, euill shall goe forth from nation to
b.JER.25.33	And the slaine of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth
b.JER.25.34	Howle yee shepheards and cry, and wallow your selues in the ashes ye
b.JER.25.35	And the shepheards shall haue no way to flee, nor the principall of the
b.JER.25.36	A voyce of the cry of the shepheards, and an howling of the principall of the
b.JER.25.37	And the peaceable habitations are cut downe because of the fierce anger of
b.JER.25.38	He hath forsaken his couert, as the Lyon: for their land is desolate, because
b.JER.25.4	And the Lord hath sent vnto you all his seruants the prophets, rising early
b.JER.25.5	They sayd, Turne yee againe now euery one from his euill way, and from the
b.JER.25.6	And goe not after other Gods to serue them, and to worship them, and prouoke
b.JER.25.7	Yet yee haue not hearkened vnto me, saith the Lord, that yee might prouoke me
b.JER.25.8	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hostes; Because yee haue not heard my words:
b.JER.25.9	Behold, I will send and take all the families of the North, saith the Lord,
b.JER.2.6	Neither sayd they, Where is the Lord that brought vs vp out of the land of
b.JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reigne of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah,
b.JER.26.10	When the Princes of Iudah heard these things, then they came vp from the
b.JER.26.11	Then spake the priests and the prophets vnto the Princes, and to all the
b.JER.26.12	Then spake Ieremiah vnto all the Princes, and to all the people, saying, The
b.JER.26.13	Therefore nowe amend your wayes, and your doings, and obey the voice of the
b.JER.26.14	As for mee, behold, I am in your hand: doe with mee as seemeth good and meet
b.JER.26.15	But know ye for certaine, That if ye put mee to death, ye shall surely bring
b.JER.26.16	Then said the Princes, and all the people, vnto the priests, and to the
b.JER.26.17	Then rose vp certaine of the Elders of the land, and spake to all the
b.JER.26.18	Micah the Morashite prophecied in the dayes of Hezekiah king of Iudah, and
b.JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah King of Iudah and all Iudah put him at all to death? did hee not
b.JER.26.2	Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the Court of the Lords house, and speake vnto
b.JER.26.20	And there was also a man that prophecied in the Name of the Lord, Urijah the
b.JER.26.21	And when Iehoiakim the king with all his mightie men, and all the princes
b.JER.26.22	And Iehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely Elnathan the sonne of
b.JER.26.23	And they fet foorth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him vnto Iehoiakim the
b.JER.26.24	Neuerthelesse, the hand of Ahikam, the sonne of Shaphan, was with Ieremiah,
b.JER.26.3	If so bee they will hearken, and turne euery man from his euill way, that I
b.JER.26.4	And thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord; If yee will not hearken to
b.JER.26.5	To hearken to the wordes of my seruants the Prophets, whom I sent vnto you,
b.JER.26.6	Then wil I make this house like Shiloh, and wil make this city a curse to all
b.JER.26.7	So the priests and the prophets, and all the people heard Ieremiah speaking
b.JER.26.8	Now it came to passe when Ieremiah had made an ende of speaking all that the
b.JER.26.9	Why hast thou prophecied in the Name of the Lord, saying, This house shalbe
b.JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentifull countrey, to eate the fruit thereof, and
b.JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reigne of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah King of Iudah,
b.JER.27.10	For they prophecie a lie vnto you, to remooue you farre from your land, and
b.JER.27.11	But the nations that bring their necke vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon,
b.JER.27.12	I spake also to Zedekiah king of Iudah according to all these wordes, saying,
b.JER.27.13	Why will yee die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by
b.JER.27.14	Therefore hearken not vnto the words of the prophets, that speake vnto you,
b.JER.27.15	For I haue not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophecie a lye in my
b.JER.27.16	Also I spake to the priests, and to all this people, saying; Thus saith the
b.JER.27.17	Hearken not vnto them: serue the king of Babylon, and liue: wherefore should
b.JER.27.18	But if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, let them
b.JER.27.19	For thus saith the Lord of hostes concerning the pillars, and concerning the
b.JER.27.2	Thus sayth the Lord to me, Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them vpon thy
b.JER.27.20	Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon tooke not, when he caried away captiue
b.JER.27.21	Yea thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, concerning the vessels
b.JER.27.22	They shall be caried to Babylon, and there shall they be vntill the day that
b.JER.27.3	And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of
b.JER.27.4	And command them to say vnto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hosts the
b.JER.27.5	I haue made the earth, the man and the beast that are vpon the ground, by my
b.JER.27.6	And now haue I giuen all these landes into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
b.JER.27.7	And all nations shall serue him and his sonne, and his sonnes sonne, vntill
b.JER.27.8	And it shall come to passe, that the nation and kingdome which will not serue
b.JER.27.9	Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diuiners, nor to your
b.JER.2.8	The Priests said not, Where is the Lord ? and they that handle the Law knew me
b.JER.28.1	And it came to passe the same yeere, in the beginning of the reigne of
b.JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet tooke the yoke from off the prophet Ieremiahs necke,
b.JER.28.11	And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying; Thus saith the
b.JER.28.12	Then the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah the Prophet (after that Hananiah
b.JER.28.13	Goe, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Thou hast broken the
b.JER.28.14	For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I haue put a yoke of
b.JER.28.15	Then said the Prophet Ieremiah vnto Hananiah the prophet, Heare nowe Hananiah:
b.JER.28.16	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Beholde, I will cast thee from off the face of
b.JER.28.17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same yeere, in the seuenth moneth.
b.JER.28.2	Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, saying; I haue broken the
b.JER.28.3	Within two full yeeres will I bring againe into this place all the vessels of
b.JER.28.4	And I will bring againe to this place Ieconiah the sonne of Iehoiakim king of
b.JER.28.5	Then the prophet Ieremiah said vnto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of
b.JER.28.6	Euen the prophet Ieremiah said; Amen: the Lord doe so, the Lord performe the
b.JER.28.7	Neuerthelesse, heare thou now this word that I speake in thine eares, and in
b.JER.28.8	The prophets that haue beene before mee, and before thee of old, prophecied
b.JER.28.9	The prophet which prophecieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall
b.JER.2.9	Wherefore, I will yet pleade with you, sayth the Lord, and with your childrens
b.JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter, that Ieremiah the prophet sent from
b.JER.29.10	For thus saith the Lord, That after seuentie yeeres be accomplished at
b.JER.29.11	For I knowe the thoughts that I thinke towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts
b.JER.29.12	Then shall ye call vpon me, and ye shall goe and pray vnto mee, and I will
b.JER.29.13	And ye shall seeke me, and finde me, when ye shall search for me with all
b.JER.29.14	And I will be found of you, saith the Lord, and I will turne away your
b.JER.29.15	Because yee haue said, The Lord hath raised vs vp prophets in Babylon:
b.JER.29.16	Know that thus saith the Lord, of the king that sitteth vpon the throne of
b.JER.29.17	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Beholde, I will send vpon them the sword, the
b.JER.29.18	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the
b.JER.29.19	Because they haue not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord, which I sent
b.JER.29.2	(After that Ieconiah the king, and the queene, and the eunuches, the princes
b.JER.29.20	Heare yee therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captiuitie, whom I
b.JER.29.21	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, of Ahab the sonne of Kolaiah,
b.JER.29.22	And of them shall bee taken vp a eurse by all the captiuitie of Iudah which
b.JER.29.23	Because they haue committed villanie in Israel, and haue committed adulterie
b.JER.29.24	Thus shalt thou also speake to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying:
b.JER.29.25	Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast
b.JER.29.26	The Lord hath made thee Priest in the stead of Iehoiada the Priest, that ye
b.JER.29.27	Now therefore why hast thou not reproued Ieremiah of Anathoth, which maketh
b.JER.29.28	For therefore he sent vnto vs in Babylon, saying, This captiuitie is long,
b.JER.29.29	And Zephaniah the Priest read this letter in the eares of Ieremiah the
b.JER.29.3	By the hand of Elasah the sonne of Shaphan, and Gemariah the sonne of Hilkiah,
b.JER.29.30	Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying;
b.JER.29.31	Send to all them of the captiuitie, saying, Thus saith the Lord, concerning
b.JER.29.32	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite
b.JER.29.4	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel vnto all that are caried away
b.JER.29.5	Build ye houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eate the fruit of
b.JER.29.6	Take ye wiues, and beget sonnes and daughters, and take wiues for your sonnes,
b.JER.29.7	And seeke the peace of the citie, whither I haue caused you to be caried away
b.JER.29.8	For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Let not your prophets and
b.JER.29.9	For they prophecie falsly vnto you in my name: I haue not sent them, saith the
b.JER.30.1	The word that came to Ieremiah from the Lord, saying,
b.JER.30.10	Therefore feare thou not, O my seruant Iacob, saith the Lord, neither be
b.JER.30.11	For I am with thee, sayeth the Lord, to saue thee: though I make a full end
b.JER.30.12	For thus saith the Lord, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grieuous.
b.JER.30.13	There is none to pleade thy cause, that thou mayest bee bonnd vp: thou hast
b.JER.30.14	All thy louers haue forgotten thee: they seeke thee not, for I haue wounded
b.JER.30.15	Why cryest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable, for the
b.JER.30.16	Therefore all they that deuoure thee shalbe deuoured, and all thine
b.JER.30.17	For I will restore health vnto thee, and I will heale thee of thy wounds,
b.JER.30.18	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring againe the captiuitie of Iacobs
b.JER.30.19	And out of them shall proceede thankesgiuing, and the voice of them that make
b.JER.30.2	Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying; Write thee all the wordes that I

b.JER.30.21	And their nobles shall be of themselues, and their gouernour shall proceede
b.JER.30.22	And yee shall be my people, and I will be your God.
b.JER.30.23	Behold, the whirlewinde of the Lord goeth foorth with furie, a continuing
b.JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the Lord shall not returne, vntill hee haue done it, and
b.JER.30.3	For loe, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will bring againe the
b.JER.30.4	And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel, and concerning
b.JER.30.5	For thus sayth the Lord, Wee haue heard a voice of trembling, of feare, and
b.JER.30.6	Aske yee now and see whether a man doeth trauaile with child? Wherefore doe I
b.JER.30.7	Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is euen the time of
b.JER.30.8	For it shall come to passe in that day, saith the Lord of hostes, that I will
b.JER.30.9	But they shall serue the Lord their God, and Dauid their King whom I will
b.JER.3.1	They say; If a man put away his wife, and she goe from him, and become another
b.JER.3.10	And yet for all this her treacherous sister Iudah hath not turned vnto mee
b.JER.3.11	And the Lord said vnto mee, The backesliding Israel hath iustified her selfe
b.JER.31.1	At the same time, saith the Lord, wil I be the God of all the families of
b.JER.31.10	Heare the word of the Lord, O yee nations, and declare it in the iles afarre
b.JER.31.11	For the Lord hath redeemed Iacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that
b.JER.31.12	Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow
b.JER.31.13	Then shall the virgine reioyce in the daunce, both yoong men and old
b.JER.31.14	And I will satiate the soule of the priests with fatnesse, and my people
b.JER.31.15	Thus saith the Lord; A voyce was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter
b.JER.31.16	Thus saith the Lord; Refraine thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from
b.JER.31.17	And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come
b.JER.31.18	I haue surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himselfe thus, Thou hast chastised me,
b.JER.31.19	Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed,
b.JER.3.12	Go and proclaime these words toward the North, and say, Returne thou
b.JER.31.2	Thus saith the Lord; The people which were left of the sword found grace in
b.JER.31.20	Is Ephraim my deare sonne? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against
b.JER.31.21	Set thee vp way-markes; make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the high
b.JER.31.22	How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the Lord hath
b.JER.31.23	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, As yet they shall vse this
b.JER.31.24	And there shall dwell in Iudah it selfe, and in all the cities thereof
b.JER.31.25	For I haue satiated the wearie soule, and I haue replenished euery sorowfull
b.JER.31.26	Upon this I awaked and beheld, and my sleepe was sweete vnto me.
b.JER.31.27	Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will sow the house of Israel,
b.JER.31.28	And it shall come to passe, that like as I haue watched ouer them, to plucke
b.JER.31.29	In those dayes they shall say no more, The fathers haue eaten a sowre grape,
b.JER.3.13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the Lord
b.JER.31.3	The Lord hath appeared of old vnto mee, saying; Yea I haue loued thee with an
b.JER.31.30	But euery one shall die for his owne iniquitie, euery man that eateth the
b.JER.31.31	Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will make a newe couenant with
b.JER.31.32	Not according to the couenant that I made with their fathers in the day that
b.JER.31.33	But this shall be the couenant, that I will make with the house of Israel,
b.JER.31.34	And they shall teach no more euery man his neighbour, and euery man his
b.JER.31.35	Thus saith the Lord which giueth the Sunne for a light by day, and the
b.JER.31.36	If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of
b.JER.31.37	Thus saith the Lord, If heauen aboue can bee measured, and the foundations of
b.JER.31.38	Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that the citie shall be built to the
b.JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall yet goe forth ouer against it, vpon the hill
b.JER.3.14	Turne, O backesliding children, saith the Lord, for I am maried vnto you: and
b.JER.31.4	Againe I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgine of Israel, thou
b.JER.31.40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields
b.JER.3.15	And I will giue you Pastours according to mine heart, which shall feede you
b.JER.31.5	Thou shalt yet plant vines vpon the mountaines of Samaria, the planters shall
b.JER.3.16	And it shall come to passe when yee bee multiplied and increased in the land;
b.JER.31.6	For there shall be a day, that the watchmen vpon the mount Ephraim shall cry;
b.JER.3.17	At that time they shall call Ierusalem the Throne of the Lord, and all the
b.JER.31.7	For thus saith the Lord, Sing with gladnesse for Iacob, and shout among the
b.JER.3.18	In those dayes the house of Iudah shall walke with the house of Israel, and
b.JER.31.8	Behold, I will bring them from the North countrey, and gather them from the
b.JER.3.19	But I said; How shall I put thee among the children, and giue thee a pleasant
b.JER.31.9	They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I leade them: I will
b.JER.3.2	Lift vp thine eyes vnto the high places, and see where thou hast not bene lien
b.JER.3.20	Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband: so haue you dealt
b.JER.3.21	A voice was heard vpon the high places, weeping and supplications of the
b.JER.32.1	The worde that came to Ieremiah from the Lord in the tenth yeere of Zedekiah
b.JER.32.10	And I subscribed the euidence, and sealed it, and tooke witnesses, and
b.JER.32.11	So I tooke the euidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according
b.JER.32.12	And I gaue the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, the
b.JER.32.13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
b.JER.32.14	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel; Take these euidences, this
b.JER.32.15	For thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel; Houses and fields, and
b.JER.32.16	Now when I had deliuered the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne
b.JER.32.17	Ah Lord God, beholde, thou hast made the heauen and the earth by thy great
b.JER.32.18	Thou shewest louing kindnesse vnto thousands, and recompensest the iniquitie
b.JER.32.19	Great in counsell, and mightie in worke, (for thine eyes are open vpon all
b.JER.3.22	Returne ye backsliding children, and I wil heale your backslidings: Beholde,
b.JER.32.2	For then the king of Babylons armie besieged Ierusalem: and Ieremiah the
b.JER.32.20	Which hast set signes and wonders in the land of Egypt, euen vnto this day,
b.JER.32.21	And hast brought foorth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt, with
b.JER.32.22	And hast giuen them this land which thou didst sweare to their fathers to
b.JER.32.23	And they came in and possessed it, but they obeied not thy voice, neither
b.JER.32.24	Beholde the mounts, they are come vnto the citie to take it, and the citie is
b.JER.32.25	And thou hast said vnto mee, O Lord God, buy thee the field for money, and
b.JER.32.26	Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying,
b.JER.32.27	Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: Is there any thing too hard for
b.JER.32.28	Therfore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will giue this citie into the hand of
b.JER.32.29	And the Caldeans that fight against this citie, shall come and set fire on
b.JER.3.23	Truely in vaine is saluation hoped for from the hilles, and from the
b.JER.32.3	For Zedekiah king of Iudah had shut him vp, saying, Wherefore doest thou
b.JER.32.30	For the children of Israel, and the children of Iudah, haue onely done euill
b.JER.32.31	For this citie hath beene to me, as a prouocation of mine anger, and of my
b.JER.32.32	Because of all the euill of the children of Israel, and of the children of
b.JER.32.33	And they haue turned vnto mee the backe, and not the face, though I taught
b.JER.32.34	But they set their abominations in the house (which is called by my Name) to
b.JER.32.35	And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the sonne
b.JER.32.36	And now therefore, thus sayth the Lord the God of Israel concerning this
b.JER.32.37	Behold, I wil gather them out of all countreys, whither I haue driuen them in
b.JER.32.38	And they shalbe my people, and I will be their God.
b.JER.32.39	And I will giue them one heart, and one way, that they may feare mee for euer,
b.JER.3.24	For shame hath deuoured the labour of our fathers from our youth: their
b.JER.32.4	And Zedekiah king of Iudah, shal not escape out of the hand of the Caldeans,
b.JER.32.40	And I will make an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will not turne away
b.JER.32.41	Yea, I will reioyce oner them to doe them good, and I will plant them in this
b.JER.32.42	For thus sayth the Lord, Like as I haue brought all this great euill vpon
b.JER.32.43	And fields shalbe bought in this land whereof ye say, It is desolate without
b.JER.32.44	Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe euidences, and seale them, and
b.JER.3.25	We lie downe in our shame, and our confusion couereth vs: for we haue sinned
b.JER.32.5	And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be vntill I visit
b.JER.32.6	And Ieremiah said; The word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.JER.32.7	Behold, Hanameel the sonne of Shallum thine vncle, shall come vnto thee,
b.JER.32.8	So Hanameel mine vncles sonne came to me in the court of the prison, according
b.JER.32.9	And I bought the field of Hanameel my vncles sonne, that was in Anathoth, and
b.JER.3.3	Therefore the showres haue bin withholden, and there hath bene no latter raine,
b.JER.33.1	Moreouer, the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah the second time (while hee
b.JER.33.10	Thus saith the Lord; Againe there shall be heard in this place (which yee say
b.JER.33.11	The voyce of ioy and the voyce of gladnesse, the voyce of the bridegroome,
b.JER.33.12	Thus saith the Lord of hostes; Againe in this place which is desolate without
b.JER.33.13	In the cities of the mountaines, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities
b.JER.33.14	Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will performe that good thing
b.JER.33.15	In those dayes, and at that time will I cause the branch of righteousnesse to
b.JER.33.16	In those dayes shall Iudah be saued, and Ierusalem shall dwell safely, and
b.JER.33.17	For thus saith the Lord; Dauid shall neuer want a man to sit vpon the throne
b.JER.33.18	Neither shall the priests the Leuites want a man before me to offer burnt
b.JER.33.19	And the word of the Lord came vnto Ieremiah, saying,
b.JER.33.2	Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish
b.JER.33.20	Thus saith the Lord; If you can breake my couenant of the day, and my
b.JER.33.21	Then may also my couenant bee broken with Dauid my seruant, that he should
b.JER.33.22	As the hoste of heauen cannot be numbred, neither the sand of the sea
b.JER.33.23	Moreouer, the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah, saying;
b.JER.33.24	Considerest thou not what this people haue spoken, saying; The two families,
b.JER.33.25	Thus saith the Lord; If my couenant be not with day and night, and if I haue
b.JER.33.26	Then will I cast away the seede of Iacob and Dauid my seruant, so that I will
b.JER.33.3	Call vnto me, and I will answere thee, and shew thee great and mightie things,
b.JER.33.4	For thus sayth the Lord the God of Israel concerning the houses of this citie,
b.JER.33.5	They come to fight with the Caldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead
b.JER.33.6	Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and wil reueale
b.JER.33.7	And I will cause the captiuitie of Iudah, and the captiuitie of Israel to
b.JER.33.8	And I will clense them from all their iniquitie, whereby they haue sinned
b.JER.33.9	And it shall be to me a name of ioy, a praise and an honour before all the
b.JER.3.4	Wilt thou not from this time cry vnto me; My father, thou art the guide of my
b.JER.34.1	The word which came vnto Ieremiah fro the Lord (when Nebuchad-nezzar king of
b.JER.34.10	Now when all the princes and all the people which had entred into the
b.JER.34.11	But afterwards they turned, and caused the seruants and the handmaids whom
b.JER.34.12	Therefore the worde of the Lord came to Ieremiah, from the Lord, saying,
b.JER.34.13	Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, I made a couenant with your fathers in
b.JER.34.14	At the end of seuen yeeres, let ye go euery man his brother an Hebrew which
b.JER.34.15	And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming
b.JER.34.16	But yee turned and polluted my Name, and caused euery man his seruant, and
b.JER.34.17	Therfore thus saith the Lord, Ye haue not hearkened vnto me, in proclaiming
b.JER.34.18	And I wil giue the men that haue transgressed my couenant, which haue not
b.JER.34.19	The princes of Iudah and the princes of Ierusalem, the eunuches, and the
b.JER.34.2	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Go, and speake to Zedekiah king of
b.JER.34.20	I will euen giue them into the hande of their enemies, and into the hand of
b.JER.34.21	And Zedekiah king of Iudah, and his Princes will I giue into the hand of
b.JER.34.22	Behold, I will command, saith the Lord, and cause them to returne to this
b.JER.34.3	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and
b.JER.34.4	Yet heare the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Iudah: Thus saith the Lord
b.JER.34.5	But thou shalt die in peace, and with the burnings of thy fathers the former
b.JER.34.6	Then Ieremiah the Prophet spake all these words vnto Zedekiah king of Iudah in
b.JER.34.7	When the king of Babylons armie fought against Ierusalem, and against all the
b.JER.34.8	This is the word that came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord, after that the king
b.JER.34.9	That euery man should let his man seruant, and euery man his maide seruant,
b.JER.3.5	Will he reserue his anger for euer? wil he keepe it to the end? Behold, thou
b.JER.35.1	The word which came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord, in the daies of Iehoiakim the
b.JER.35.10	But wee haue dwelt in tents, and haue obeyed, and done according to all that
b.JER.35.11	But it came to passe when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came vp into the
b.JER.35.12	Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah, saying,
b.JER.35.13	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Goe and tel the men of Iudah,
b.JER.35.14	The wordes of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab, that hee commanded his sonnes, not
b.JER.35.15	I haue sent also vnto you all my seruants the Prophets, rising vp early and
b.JER.35.16	Because the sonnes of Ionadab, the sonne of Rechab, haue performed the
b.JER.35.17	Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hostes, the God of Israel, Behold, I
b.JER.35.18	And Ieremiah sayd vnto the house of the Rechabites, Thus sayth the Lord of
b.JER.35.19	Therefore thus sayth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Ionadab the son
b.JER.35.2	Goe vnto the house of the Rechabites, and speake vnto them, and bring them
b.JER.35.3	Then I tooke Iaazaniah the sonne of Ieremiah the sonne of Habazimah and his
b.JER.35.4	And I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sonnes
b.JER.35.5	And I set before the sonnes of the house of the Rechabites, pottes, full of
b.JER.35.6	But they said, We will drinke no wine: for Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our
b.JER.35.7	Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant Uineyard, nor haue any:
b.JER.35.8	Thus haue we obeyed the voice of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father, in
b.JER.35.9	Nor to build houses for vs to dwel in, neither haue we Uineyard, nor field,
b.JER.3.6	The Lord said also vnto me, in the daies of Iosiah the king, Hast thou seene
b.JER.36.1	And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king
b.JER.36.10	Then read Baruch in the booke, the wordes of Ieremiah in the house of the
b.JER.36.11	When Michaiah the sonne of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan had heard out of the
b.JER.36.12	Then hee went downe into the kings house into the scribes chamber, and loe,
b.JER.36.13	Then Michaiah declared vnto them all the words that hee had heard when Baruch
b.JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nethaniah, the sonne of
b.JER.36.15	And they sayde vnto him, Sit downe now and read it in our eares. So Baruch
b.JER.36.16	Now it came to passe when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both
b.JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell vs now, How diddest thou write all these
b.JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, Hee pronounced all these words vnto me with his
b.JER.36.19	Then said the Princes vnto Baruch, Go hide thee, thou and Ieremiah, and let
b.JER.36.2	Take thee a roule of a booke, and write therein all the words that I haue
b.JER.36.20	And they went in to the King into the Court, bnt they layed vp the roule in
b.JER.36.21	So the king sent Iehudi to fet the roule, and hee tooke it out of Elishama
b.JER.36.22	Now the king sate in the winter house, in the ninth moneth, &amp; there was a
b.JER.36.23	And it came to passe that when Iehudi had read three or foure leaues, he cut
b.JER.36.24	Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any
b.JER.36.25	Neuerthelesse Elnathan, and Delaiah &amp; Gemariah had made intercession to
b.JER.36.26	But the king commaunded Ierahmeel the sonne of Hammelech, and Seraiah the
b.JER.36.27	Then the word of the Lord came to Ieremiah (after that the king had burnt the
b.JER.36.28	Take thee againe another roule, and write in it all the former words that
b.JER.36.29	And thou shalt say to Iehoiakim king of Iudah, Thus sayth the Lord, Thou hast
b.JER.36.3	It may be that the house of Iudah will heare all the euil which I purpose to
b.JER.36.30	Therefore thus saith the Lord of Iehoiakim king of Iudah; He shall haue none
b.JER.36.31	And I will punish him and his seede, and his seruants for their iniquitie,
b.JER.36.32	Then tooke Ieremiah another roule, and gaue it to Baruch the scribe the sonne
b.JER.36.4	Then Ieremiah called Baruch the sonne of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the
b.JER.36.5	And Ieremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut vp, I cannot goe into the
b.JER.36.6	Therefore goe thou and reade in the roule, which thou hast written from my
b.JER.36.7	It may bee they will present their supplication before the Lord, and will
b.JER.36.8	And Baruch the sonne of Neriah did according to all that Ieremiah the Prophet
b.JER.36.9	And it came to passe in the fifth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king
b.JER.3.7	And I said after she had done all these things; Turne thou vnto me: but shee
b.JER.37.1	And king Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah reigned in stead of Coniah the son of
b.JER.37.10	For though yee had smitten the whole armie of the Caldeans that fight against
b.JER.37.11	And it came to passe that when the armie of the Caldeans was broken vp from
b.JER.37.12	Then Ieremiah went forth out of Ierusalem to goe into the lande of Beniamin,
b.JER.37.13	And when he was in the gate of Beniamin, a captaine of the warde was there,
b.JER.37.14	Then said Ieremiah, It is false, I fall not away to the Caldeans: but he
b.JER.37.15	Wherfore the princes were wroth with Ieremiah, and smote him, and put him in
b.JER.37.16	When Ieremiah was entred into the dungeon, and into the cabbins, and Ieremiah
b.JER.37.17	Then Zedekiah the king sent and tooke him out, and the king asked him
b.JER.37.18	Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto king Zedekiah, What haue I offended against thee,
b.JER.37.19	Where are now your prophets, which prophecied vnto you, saying, The king of
b.JER.37.2	But neither he, nor his seruants, nor the people of the land, did hearken vnto
b.JER.37.20	Therefore heare now, I pray thee, O my Lord the king; let my supplication, I
b.JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Ieremiah into the
b.JER.37.3	And Zedekiah the king sent Iehucal the sonne of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the
b.JER.37.4	Nowe Ieremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him
b.JER.37.5	Then Pharaohs armie was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Caldeans that
b.JER.37.6	Then came the word of the Lord vnto the Prophet Ieremiah, saying,
b.JER.37.7	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Iudah,
b.JER.37.8	And the Caldeans shall come againe, and fight against this citie and take it,
b.JER.37.9	Thus saith the Lord, Deceiue not your selues, saying, The Caldeans shall
b.JER.3.8	And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed
b.JER.38.1	Then Shephatiah the sonne of Mattan, and Gedaliah the sonne of Pashur and
b.JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence
b.JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech tooke the men with him, and went into the house of the king
b.JER.38.12	And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said vnto Ieremiah, Put now these old cast
b.JER.38.13	So they drew vp Ieremiah with cordes, and tooke him vp out of the dungeon,
b.JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent, and tooke Ieremiah the Prophet vnto him into the
b.JER.38.15	Then Ieremiah said vnto Zedekiah, If I declare it vnto thee, wilt thou not
b.JER.38.16	So the king sware secretly vnto Ieremiah, saying, As the Lord liueth that
b.JER.38.17	Then said Ieremiah vnto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord the God of hostes, the
b.JER.38.18	But if thou wilt not goe foorth to the king of Babylons Princes, then shall
b.JER.38.19	And Zedekiah the king said vnto Ieremiah, I am afraid of the Iewes that are
b.JER.38.2	Thus saith the Lord, He that remaineth in this citie, shall die by the sword,
b.JER.38.20	But Ieremiah said, They shall not deliuer thee: obey, I beseech thee, the
b.JER.38.21	But if thou refuse to goe foorth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed
b.JER.38.22	And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Iudahs house, shalbe
b.JER.38.23	So they shall bring out all thy wiues, and thy children to the Caldeans, and
b.JER.38.24	Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou
b.JER.38.25	But if the Princes heare that I haue talked with thee, and they come vnto
b.JER.38.26	Then thou shalt say vnto them, I presented my supplication before the king,
b.JER.38.27	Then came all the Princes vnto Ieremiah, and asked him, and he told them
b.JER.38.28	So Ieremiah abode in the court of the prison, vntill the day that Ierusalem
b.JER.38.3	Thus saith the Lord, This citie shall surely be giuen into the hand of the

b.JER.39.1	In the ninth yeere of Zedekiah king of Iudah, in the tenth moneth, came
b.JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard left of the poore of the people
b.JER.39.11	Now Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon gaue charge coucerning Ieremiah to
b.JER.39.12	Take him, and looke well to him, and doe him no harme, but doe vnto him euen

b.JER.39.2	And in the eleuenth yeere of Zedekiah, in the fourth moneth, the ninth day of
b.JER.39.3	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sate in the middle
b.JER.39.4	And it came to passe, that when Zedekiah the king of Iudah saw them and all

b.JER.39.8	And the Caldeans burnt the kings house, and the houses of the people with
b.JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard caried away captiue into Babylon
b.JER.40.1	The word which came to Ieremiah fro the Lord after that Nebuzaradan the
b.JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serue the Caldeans, which will

b.JER.40.5	Now while he was not yet gone backe, he sayd, Goe backe also to Gedaliah the

b.JER.41.14	So all the people that Ishmael had caried away captiue from Mizpah cast about
b.JER.41.15	But Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah escaped from Iohanan with eight men, and
b.JER.41.16	Then tooke Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces
b.JER.41.17	And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by
b.JER.41.18	Because of the Caldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the
b.JER.4.12	Euen a full winde from those places shall come vnto mee: now also will I giue
b.JER.41.2	Then arose Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him,
b.JER.4.13	Behold, hee shall come vp as cloudes, and his charets shall bee as a

b.JER.41.5	That there came certaine from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, euen

b.JER.42.1	Then all the captaines of the forces, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and
b.JER.42.10	If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you
b.JER.42.11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom yee are afraid: be not afraid

b.JER.42.17	So shall it bee with all the men that set their faces to goe into Egypt to
b.JER.42.18	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, As mine anger and my
b.JER.42.19	The Lord hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Iudah, Goe ye not into
b.JER.4.22	For my people is foolish, they haue not knowen me, they are sottish children,
b.JER.42.2	And said vnto Ieremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be
b.JER.42.20	For ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me vnto the Lord your God,
b.JER.42.21	And now I haue this day declared it to you, but ye haue not obeied the voice
b.JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly, that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine,
b.JER.4.23	I beheld the earth, and loe, it was without forme and void: and the heauens,
b.JER.42.3	That the Lord thy God may shew vs the way wherein we may walke, and the thing
b.JER.4.24	I beheld the mountaines, and loe they trembled, and all the hilles mooued

b.JER.4.25	I behelde, and loe, there was no man, and all the birdes of the heauens were
b.JER.42.5	Then they sayd to Ieremiah, The Lord be a true and faithfull witnesse betweene
b.JER.4.26	I beheld, and loe, the fruitfull place was a wildernesse, and all the cities
b.JER.42.6	Whether it be good, or whether it be euill, we will obey the voice of the Lord
b.JER.4.27	For thus hath the Lord said; The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not
b.JER.42.7	And it came to passe after tenne dayes, that the word of the Lord came vnto
b.JER.4.28	For this shall the earth mourne, and the heauens aboue be blacke: because I

b.JER.4.29	The whole citie shall flee, for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen, they
b.JER.42.9	And said vnto them, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, vnto whom ye sent
b.JER.4.3	For thus saith the Lord to the men of Iudah and Ierusalem, Breake vp your
b.JER.4.30	And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou doe? though thou clothest thy selfe
b.JER.4.31	For I haue heard a voice as of a woman in trauel, and the anguish as of her
b.JER.43.1	And it came to passe that whe Ieremiah had made an end of speaking vnto all
b.JER.43.10	And say vnto them, Thus saieth the Lord of hosts the God of Israel; Beholde,
b.JER.43.11	And when he commeth, hee shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliuer such as
b.JER.43.12	And I wil kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and hee shall
b.JER.43.13	He shall breake also the images of Beth-shemesh that is in the land of Egypt,
b.JER.43.2	Then spake Azariah the sonne of Hoshaiah, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and
b.JER.43.3	But Baruch the sonne of Neriah setteth thee on against vs, for to deliuer vs
b.JER.43.4	So Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, and all
b.JER.43.5	But Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, tooke
b.JER.43.6	Euen men, and women, and children, and the kings daughters, and euery person
b.JER.43.7	So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voyce of the
b.JER.43.8	Then came the word of the Lord vnto Ieremiah in Tahpanhes, saying;
b.JER.43.9	Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the bricke kill,
b.JER.4.4	Circumcise your selues to the Lord, and take away the foreskinnes of your
b.JER.44.1	The word that came to Ieremiah concerning all the Iewes which dwel in the land
b.JER.44.10	They are not humbled euen vnto this day, neither haue they feared, nor walked
b.JER.44.11	Therefore thus sayeth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Behold, I will
b.JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Iudah, that haue set their faces to goe into
b.JER.44.13	For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I haue punished
b.JER.44.14	So that none of the remnant of Iudah which are gone into the land of Egypt to
b.JER.44.15	Then all the men which knew that their wiues had burnt incense vnto other
b.JER.44.16	As for the word that thou hast spoken vnto vs in the name of the Lord, we
b.JER.44.17	But we will certainly doe whatsoeuer thing goeth forth out of our owne mouth,
b.JER.44.18	But since we left off to burne incense to the queene of heauen, and to powre
b.JER.44.19	And when we burnt incense to the queene of heauen, and powred out drinke
b.JER.44.2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye haue seene all the euill
b.JER.44.20	Then Ieremiah sayd vnto all the people, to the men and to the women, and to
b.JER.44.21	The incense that yee burnt in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of
b.JER.44.22	So that the Lord could no longer beare, because of the euill of your doings,
b.JER.44.23	Because you haue burnt incense, and because yee haue sinned against the Lord,
b.JER.44.24	Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto all the people, and to all the women; Heare the
b.JER.44.25	Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel, saying: Yee and your wiues
b.JER.44.26	Therefore heare yee the word of the Lord, all Iudah that dwell in the land of
b.JER.44.27	Behold, I will watch ouer them for euill, and not for good, and all the men
b.JER.44.28	Yet a small number that escape the sword, shall returne out of the land of
b.JER.44.29	And this shalbe a signe vnto you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in
b.JER.44.3	Because of their wickednes which they haue committed, to prouoke me to anger,
b.JER.44.30	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will giue Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into
b.JER.44.4	Howbeit I sent vnto you all my seruants the Prophets, rising early and sending
b.JER.44.5	But they hearkened not, nor enclined their eare to turne from their wickednes,
b.JER.44.6	Wherefore my furie and mine anger was powred forth, and was kindled in the
b.JER.44.7	Therefore now thus saith the Lord the God of hostes, the God of Israel,
b.JER.44.8	In that yee prouoke mee vnto wrath with the workes of your hands, burning
b.JER.44.9	Haue ye forgotten the wickednes of your fathers, and the wickednesse of the
b.JER.4.5	Declare ye in Iudah, and publish in Ierusalem, and say, Blow yee the Trumpet
b.JER.45.1	The word that Ieremiah the Prophet spake vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, when
b.JER.45.2	Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel vnto thee, O Baruch,
b.JER.45.3	Thou didst say, Woe is me now, for the Lord hath added griefe to my sorow, I
b.JER.45.4	Thus shalt thou say vnto him, The Lord saith thus, Behold, that which I haue
b.JER.45.5	And seekest thou great things for thy selfe? seeke them not: for behold, I wil
b.JER.4.6	Set vp the standards toward Zion: retyre, stay not; for I will bring euil from
b.JER.46.1	The word of the Lord which came to Ieremiah the Prophet, against the Gentiles,
b.JER.46.10	For this is the day of the Lord God of hostes, a day of vengeance, that he
b.JER.46.11	Goe vp into Gilead, and take balme, O virgine, the daughter of Egypt: in
b.JER.46.12	The nations haue heard of thy shame, and thy crie hath filled the land: for

b.JER.46.17	They did crie there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise, he hath passed the
b.JER.46.18	As I liue, saith the King, whose Name is the Lord of hostes, Surely as Tabor
b.JER.46.19	Oh thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thy selfe to goe into captiuitie:
b.JER.46.2	Against Egypt, against the armie of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was by
b.JER.46.20	Egypt is like a very faire heifer, but destruction commeth: it commeth out of
b.JER.46.21	Also her hired men are in the midst of her, like fatted bullocks, for they

b.JER.46.27	But feare not thou, O my seruant Iacob, and be not dismaied, O Israel: for
b.JER.46.28	Feare thou not, O Iacob my seruant, saith the Lord, for I am with thee, for I

b.JER.47.7	How can it bee quiet, seeing the Lord hath giuen it a charge against Ashkelon,
b.JER.4.8	For this gird you with sackcloth; lament and howle: for the fierce anger of
b.JER.48.1	Against Moab thus sayth the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Woe vnto Nebo,
b.JER.48.10	Cursed be he that doeth the worke of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he
b.JER.48.11	Moab hath bene at ease from his youth, and hee hath setled on his lees, and
b.JER.48.12	Therfore behold, the dayes come, sayth the Lord, that I will send vnto him
b.JER.48.13	And Moab shall bee ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of

b.JER.48.2	There shall bee no more prayse of Moab: in Heshbon they haue deuised euill
b.JER.48.20	Moab is confounded, for it is broken downe: howle and cry, tell ye it in
b.JER.48.21	And iudgement is come vpon the plaine countrey, vpon Holon, and vpon Iahazah,
b.JER.48.22	And vpon Dibon, and vpon Nebo, and vpon Beth-diblathaim,
b.JER.48.23	And vpon Kiriathaim, and vpon Beth-Gamul, and vpon Beth-meon,

b.JER.48.25	The horne of Moab is cut off, &amp; his arme is broken, saith the Lord.
b.JER.48.26	Make ye him drunken: for hee magnified himselfe against the Lord: Moab also

b.JER.48.30	I knowe his wrath, sayeth the Lord, but it shall not be so, his lyes shall

b.JER.48.39	They shall howle, saying; How is it broken downe? how hath Moab turned the
b.JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed, her little ones haue caused a crie to be heard.
b.JER.48.40	For thus saith the Lord, Behold, hee shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread
b.JER.48.41	Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, &amp; the mighty mens
b.JER.48.42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified
b.JER.48.43	Feare, and the pit, and the snare shall be vpon thee, O inhabitant of Moab,
b.JER.48.44	Hee that fleeth from the feare shall fall into the pit, and he that getteth
b.JER.48.45	They that fled, stood vnder the shadow of Heshbon, because of the force: but
b.JER.48.46	Woe be vnto thee, O Moab, the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sonnes are
b.JER.48.47	Yet will I bring againe the captiuitie of Moab in the later dayes, saith the
b.JER.48.5	For in the going vp of Luhith continuall weeping shall go vp; for in the going
b.JER.48.6	Flee, saue your liues, and be like the heath in the wildernesse.
b.JER.48.7	For because thou hast trusted in thy workes, and in thy treasures, thou shalt

b.JER.48.9	Giue wings vnto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof
b.JER.4.9	And it shall come to passe at that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the
b.JER.49.1	Concerning the Ammonites, thus sayth the Lord; hath Israel no sonnes? Hath he
b.JER.49.10	But I haue made Esau bare, I haue vncouered his secret places, and he shall
b.JER.49.11	Leaue thy fatherlesse children, I will preserue them aliue: and let thy

b.JER.49.16	Thy terriblenesse hath deceiued thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou
b.JER.49.17	Also Edom shalbe a desolation: euery one that goeth by it shalbe astonished,
b.JER.49.18	As in the ouerthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbour cities thereof,
b.JER.49.19	Behold, he shal come vp like a lyon from the swelling of Iordane against the

b.JER.49.20	Therfore heare the counsell of the Lord, that he hath taken against Edom,
b.JER.49.21	The earth is moued at the noise of their fall: at the crie, the noise thereof
b.JER.49.22	Behold, he shall come vp and flie as the eagle, and spread his wings ouer
b.JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus, Hamath is confounded, &amp; Arpad, for they haue heard

b.JER.49.26	Therefore her yong men shal fall in her streets, and all the men of warre
b.JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shal consume the
b.JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchad-rezzar
b.JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shal take to
b.JER.49.3	Howle, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry yee daughters of Rabbah, gird yee
b.JER.49.30	Flee, get you farre off, dwell deepe, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the

b.JER.51.39	In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that

b.JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount vp to heauen, and though shee should fortifie the
b.JER.51.54	A sound of a crie commeth from Babylon, and great destruction from the land
b.JER.51.55	Because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great

b.JER.5.16	Their quiuer is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
b.JER.51.6	Flee out of the middest of Babylon, and deliuer euery man his soule: bee not
b.JER.51.60	So Ieremiah wrote in a booke all the euill that should come vpon Babylon:
b.JER.51.61	And Ieremiah said to Seraiah, When thou commest to Babylon, and shalt see,
b.JER.51.62	Then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it
b.JER.51.63	And it shall bee when thou hast made an end of reading this booke, that thou
b.JER.51.64	And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sinke, and shall not rise from the
b.JER.5.17	And they shall eate vp thine haruest and thy bread, which thy sonnes and thy
b.JER.51.7	Babylon hath beene a golden cup in the Lords hand, that made all the earth
b.JER.5.18	Neuerthelesse in those daies, saith the Lord, I will not make a full end with
b.JER.51.8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howle for her, take balme for her
b.JER.5.19	And it shall come to passe when yee shall say; Wherefore doth the Lord our
b.JER.51.9	We would haue healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let vs

b.JER.5.20	Declare this in the house of Iacob, and publish it in Iudah saying;
b.JER.5.21	Heare now this, O foolish people, and without vnderstanding, which haue eyes
b.JER.52.1	Zedekiah was one and twentie yeere olde when he began to reigne, and he

b.JER.52.14	And all the armie of the Caldeans that were with the captaine of the guard,
b.JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard, caried away captiue certaine of

b.JER.52.2	And hee did that which was euill in the eyes of the Lord, according to all
b.JER.52.20	The two pillars, one Sea, and twelue brasen bulles, that were vnder the

b.JER.52.29	In the eighteenth yeere of Nebuchad-rezzar hee caried away captiue from
b.JER.5.23	But this people hath a reuolting and a rebellious heart: they are reuolted
b.JER.52.3	For through the anger of the Lord it came to passe in Ierusalem and Iudah,
b.JER.52.30	In the three and twentith yeere of Nebuchad-rezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captaine
b.JER.52.31	And it came to passe in the seuen and thirtieth yeere of the captiuitie of
b.JER.52.32	And spake kindly vnto him, and set his throne aboue the throne of the kings
b.JER.52.33	And changed his prison garments: and hee did continually eate bread before
b.JER.52.34	And for his diet, there was a continuall diet giuen him of the king of

b.JER.5.26	For among my people are found wicked men: they lay waite as hee that setteth
b.JER.52.6	And in the fourth moneth, in the ninth day of the moneth, the famine was sore
b.JER.5.27	As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore
b.JER.52.7	Then the city was broken vp, and all the men of warre fled, and went foorth
b.JER.5.28	They are waxen fat, they shine: yea they ouerpasse the deedes of the wicked:
b.JER.52.8	But the armie of the Caldeans pursued after the king, and ouertooke Zedekiah
b.JER.5.29	Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord ? shall not my soule be

b.JER.5.30	A wonderfull and horrible thing is committed in the land.
b.JER.5.31	The prophets prophecie falsely, and the priests beare rule by their meanes,
b.JER.5.4	Therefore I said, Surely these are poore, they are foolish: for they know not

b.JER.6.13	For from the least of them euen vnto the greatest of them, euery one is giuen
b.JER.6.14	They haue healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people sleightly,
b.JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay they were not at
b.JER.6.16	Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the wayes and see, and aske for the old
b.JER.6.17	Also I set watchmen ouer you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet:
b.JER.6.18	Therefore heare ye nations, and know, O Congregation what is among them.
b.JER.6.19	Heare, O earth, behold, I will bring euill vpon this people, euen the fruit
b.JER.6.2	I haue likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
b.JER.6.20	To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba? and the sweet cane
b.JER.6.21	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will lay stumbling blockes before
b.JER.6.22	Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people commeth from the North countrey, and a

b.JER.6.4	Prepare yee warre against her: arise, and let vs goe vp at noone: woe vnto vs,
b.JER.6.5	Arise, and let vs goe by night, and let vs destroy her palaces.
b.JER.6.6	For thus hath the Lord of hostes said; Hew yee downe trees and cast a mount
b.JER.6.7	As a fountaine casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickednesse:
b.JER.6.8	Be thou instructed, O Ierusalem, lest my soule depart from thee: lest I make
b.JER.6.9	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall throughly gleane the remnant of
b.JER.7.1	The word that came to Ieremiah from the Lord, saying,
b.JER.7.10	And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my Name, and
b.JER.7.11	Is this house, which is called by my Name, become a denne of robbers in your

b.JER.7.14	Therefore will I doe vnto this house, which is called by my Name, wherein yee

b.JER.7.16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift vp cry nor prayer for
b.JER.7.17	Seest thou not what they doe in the cities of Iudah, and in the streets of
b.JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, &amp; the women
b.JER.7.19	Doe they prouoke mee to anger, saith the Lord ? Doe they not prouoke
b.JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of the Lords house, and proclaime there this word, and say,
b.JER.7.20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, mine anger and my furie shalbe

b.JER.7.22	For I spake not vnto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I

b.JER.7.25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt vnto this
b.JER.7.26	Yet they hearkned not vnto me, nor inclined their eare, but hardened their

b.JER.7.29	Cut off thine haire, O Ierusalem, and cast it away, and take vp a lamentation
b.JER.7.3	Thus saith the Lord of hostes the God of Israel; Amend your wayes, and your

b.JER.7.33	And the carkeises of this people shall be meate for the fowles of the heauen,
b.JER.7.34	Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Iudah, and from the streets of
b.JER.7.4	Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the

b.JER.7.6	If ye oppresse not the stranger, the fatherlesse and the widow, and shed not
b.JER.7.7	Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gaue to your
b.JER.7.8	Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
b.JER.7.9	Will ye steale, murther, and commit adulterie, and sweare falsly, and burne
b.JER.8.1	At that time, sayeth the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of

b.JER.8.16	The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the

b.JER.8.18	When I would comfort my selfe against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.
b.JER.8.19	Behold the voice of the crie of the daughter of my people because of them
b.JER.8.2	And they shall spread them before the Sunne, and the Moone, and all the hoste
b.JER.8.20	The haruest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saued.
b.JER.8.21	For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt, I am blacke:
b.JER.8.22	Is there no balme in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the
b.JER.8.3	And death shall bee chosen rather then life, by all the residue of them that
b.JER.8.4	Moreouer thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord, Shall they fall, and
b.JER.8.5	Why then is this people of Ierusalem slidden backe, by a perpetual

b.JOB.11.11	For, he knoweth vaine men: hee seeth wickednesse also, will he not then

b.JOB.11.13	If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him:
b.JOB.11.14	If iniquitie be in thine hand, put it farre away, and let not wickednes dwell
b.JOB.11.15	For then shalt thou lift vp thy face without spot, yea thou shalt be stedfast,
b.JOB.11.16	Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that passe

b.JOB.11.8	It is as high as heauen, what canst thou doe? deeper then hell, what canst

b.JOB.11.9	The measure therof is longer then the earth, and broader then the sea.
b.JOB.1.2	And there were borne vnto him seuen sonnes, and three daughters.
b.JOB.1.20	Then Iob arose, and rent his mantle, and shaued his head, and fell downe vpon
b.JOB.1.21	And said, Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne
b.JOB.12.1	And Iob answered, and sayd,
b.JOB.12.10	In whose hand is the soule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all
b.JOB.12.11	Doeth not the eare trie wordes? And the mouth taste his meate?
b.JOB.12.12	With the ancient is wisedome, and in length of dayes, vnderstanding.
b.JOB.12.13	With him is wisedome &amp; strength, he hath counsell and vnderstanding.
b.JOB.12.14	Behold, he breaketh downe, and it cannot be built againe: hee shutteth vp a
b.JOB.12.15	Behold, hee withholdeth the waters, and they drie vp: also hee sendeth them
b.JOB.12.16	With him is strength &amp; wisedome: the deceiued, and the deceiuer, are his.
b.JOB.12.17	He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the Iudges fooles.
b.JOB.12.18	He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loines with a girdle.
b.JOB.12.19	He leadeth Princes away spoiled, and ouerthroweth the mightie.
b.JOB.1.22	In all this Iob sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
b.JOB.12.2	No doubt but ye are the people, and wisedome shall die with you.
b.JOB.12.20	He remooueth away the speech of the trustie, and taketh away the

b.JOB.12.22	Hee discouereth deepe things out of darkenesse, and bringeth out to light the

b.JOB.12.24	He taketh away the heart of the chiefe of the people of the earth, and
b.JOB.12.25	They grope in the darke without light, and hee maketh them to stagger like a

b.JOB.12.4	I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth vpon God, and he answereth
b.JOB.12.5	He that is ready to slippe with his feet, is as a lamp despised in the thought
b.JOB.12.6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that prouoke God are secure, into
b.JOB.12.7	But aske now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the foules of the aire,
b.JOB.12.8	Or speake to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea
b.JOB.12.9	Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?
b.JOB.1.3	His substance also was seuen thousand sheepe, and three thousand camels, and
b.JOB.13.1	Loe, mine eye hath seene all this, mine eare hath heard and vnderstood it.
b.JOB.13.10	He will surely reprooue you, if yee doe secretly accept persons.
b.JOB.13.11	Shall not his excellencie make you afraid? and his dread fall vpon you?
b.JOB.13.12	Your remembrances are like vnto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
b.JOB.13.13	Hold your peace, let me alone that I may speake, and let come on me what
b.JOB.13.14	Wherefore doe I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
b.JOB.13.15	Though hee slay mee, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintaine mine owne
b.JOB.13.16	Hee also shall be my saluation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
b.JOB.13.17	Heare diligently my speach, and my declaration with your eares.
b.JOB.13.18	Behold now, I haue ordered my cause, I know that I shall be iustified.
b.JOB.13.19	Who is hee that will plead with me? for now if I hold my tongue, I shall giue
b.JOB.13.2	What yee know, the same doe I know also, I am not inferiour vnto you.
b.JOB.13.20	Only doe not two things vnto me: then will I not hide my selfe from thee.
b.JOB.13.21	Withdrawe thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make mee afraid.
b.JOB.13.22	Then call thou, and I will answere: or let me speake, and answere thou mee.
b.JOB.13.23	How many are mine iniquities and sinnes? make mee to knowe my transgression,
b.JOB.13.24	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemie?
b.JOB.13.25	Wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the drie
b.JOB.13.26	For thou writest bitter things against mee, and makest me to possesse the
b.JOB.13.27	Thou puttest my feete also in the stockes, and lookest narrowly vnto all my
b.JOB.13.28	And hee, as a rotten thing consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten.
b.JOB.13.3	Surely I would speake to the Almighty, &amp; I desire to reason with God.
b.JOB.13.4	But ye are forgers of lies, yee are all Physicians of no value.
b.JOB.13.5	O that you would altogether hold your peace, &amp; it should be your wisdome.
b.JOB.13.6	Heare now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
b.JOB.13.7	Wil you speake wickedly for God? and talke deceitfully for him?
b.JOB.13.8	Will ye accept his person? Will yee contend for God?
b.JOB.13.9	Is it good that hee should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, doe
b.JOB.1.4	And his sonnes went and feasted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent
b.JOB.14.1	Man that is borne of a woman, is of few dayes, and full of trouble.
b.JOB.14.10	But man dyeth, and wasteth away; yea, man giueth vp the ghost, and where is
b.JOB.14.11	As the waters faile from the sea, and the floud decayeth and dryeth vp:
b.JOB.14.12	So man lyeth downe, and riseth not, till the heauens be no more, they shall

b.JOB.14.14	If a man die, shall he liue againe? All the dayes of my appointed time will I
b.JOB.14.15	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt haue a desire to the worke
b.JOB.14.16	For nowe thou numbrest my steppes, doest thou not watch ouer my sinne?
b.JOB.14.17	My transgression is sealed vp in a bagge, and thou sowest vp mine iniquitie.
b.JOB.14.18	And surely the mountaine falling commeth to nought: and the rocke is remoued
b.JOB.14.19	The waters weare the stones, thou washest away the things which growe out of
b.JOB.14.2	Hee commeth forth like a flower, and is cut downe: he fleeth also, as a
b.JOB.14.20	Thou preuailest for euer against him, and hee passeth: thou changest his
b.JOB.14.21	His sonnes come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought lowe,
b.JOB.14.22	But his flesh vpon him shall haue paine, and his soule within him shall
b.JOB.14.3	And doest thou open thine eies vpon such an one, and bringest me into iudgment
b.JOB.14.4	Who can bring a cleane thing out of an vncleane? not one.
b.JOB.14.5	Seeing his daies are determined, the number of his moneths are with thee, thou
b.JOB.14.6	Turne from him that hee may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hircling,
b.JOB.14.7	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut downe, that it will sprout againe,
b.JOB.14.8	Though the roote thereof waxe old in the earth, and the stocke thereof die in
b.JOB.14.9	Yet through the sent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughes like a
b.JOB.1.5	And it was so, when the dayes of their feasting were gone about, that Iob sent
b.JOB.15.1	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
b.JOB.15.10	With vs are both the gray headed, and very aged men, much elder then thy
b.JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with
b.JOB.15.12	Why doeth thine heart carie thee away? and what doe thine eyes winke at,
b.JOB.15.13	That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words goe out of
b.JOB.15.14	What is man, that he should be cleane? and he which is borne of a woman, that
b.JOB.15.15	Beholde, he putteth no trust in his Saints, yea, the heauens are not cleane
b.JOB.15.16	How much more abominable and filthie is man, which drinketh iniquitie like
b.JOB.15.17	I will shew thee, heare me, and that which I haue seene, I wil declare,
b.JOB.15.18	Which wise men haue tolde from their fathers, and haue not hid it:
b.JOB.15.19	Unto whom alone the earth was giuen, and no stranger passed among them.
b.JOB.15.2	Should a wise man vtter vaine knowledge, and fill his belly with the East
b.JOB.15.20	The wicked man trauaileth with paine all his dayes, and the number of yeeres
b.JOB.15.21	A dreadfull sound is in his eares; in prosperitie the destroyer shall come
b.JOB.15.22	He beleeueth not that he shall returne out of darkenesse, and he is waited
b.JOB.15.23	He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day
b.JOB.15.24	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall preuaile against him,
b.JOB.15.25	For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himselfe
b.JOB.15.26	He runneth vpon him, euen on his necke, vpon the thicke bosses of his
b.JOB.15.27	Because he couereth his face with his fatnesse, and maketh collops of fat on
b.JOB.15.28	And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth,
b.JOB.15.29	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he
b.JOB.15.3	Should hee reason with vnprofitable talke? or with speeches wherewith he can
b.JOB.15.30	He shall not depart out of darkenesse, the flame shall drie vp his branches,
b.JOB.15.31	Let not him that is deceiued, trust in vanitie: for vanitie shalbe his
b.JOB.15.32	It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not bee greene.
b.JOB.15.33	He shal shake off his vnripe grape as the Uine, and shall cast off his flowre
b.JOB.15.34	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume
b.JOB.15.35	They conceiue mischiefe, and bring forth vanitie, and their belly prepareth
b.JOB.15.4	Yea thou castest off feare, and restrainest prayer before God.
b.JOB.15.5	For thy mouth vttereth thine iniquitie, and thou choosest the tongue of the
b.JOB.15.6	Thine owne mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea thine owne lippes testifie
b.JOB.15.7	Art thou the first man that was borne? or wast thou made before the hilles?
b.JOB.15.8	Hast thou heard the secret of God? and doest thou restraine wisedome to thy
b.JOB.15.9	What knowest thou that we know not? what vnderstandest thou, which is not in
b.JOB.1.6	Now there was a day, when the sons of God came to present themselues before
b.JOB.16.1	Then Iob answered, and said,
b.JOB.16.10	They haue gaped vpon me with their mouth, they haue smitten me vpon the
b.JOB.16.11	God hath deliuered me to the vngodly, and turned me ouer into the hands of
b.JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my
b.JOB.16.13	His archers compasse me round about, he cleaueth my reines asunder, and doeth
b.JOB.16.14	He breaketh me with breach vpon breach, he runneth vpon me like a giant.
b.JOB.16.15	I haue sowed sackcloth vpon my skin, and defiled my horne in the dust.
b.JOB.16.16	My face is fowle with weeping, and on mine eye-lids is the shadow of death;
b.JOB.16.17	Not for any iniustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
b.JOB.16.18	O earth couer not thou my blood, and let my cry haue no place.
b.JOB.16.19	Also now, behold my witnesse is in heauen, and my record is on high.
b.JOB.16.2	I haue heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
b.JOB.16.20	My friends scorne me: but mine eye powreth out teares vnto God.
b.JOB.16.21	O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his
b.JOB.16.22	When a few yeeres are come, then I shall goe the way whence I shall not
b.JOB.16.3	Shall vaine words haue an ende? or what emboldeneth thee, that thou answerest?
b.JOB.16.4	I also could speake as yee doe: if your soule were in my soules stead, I could
b.JOB.16.5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the mouing of my lips should
b.JOB.16.6	Though I speake, my griefe is not asswaged: and though I forbeare; what am I
b.JOB.16.7	But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate al my companie.
b.JOB.16.8	And thou hast filled mee with wrinckles, which is a witnesse against me: and
b.JOB.16.9	He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth vpon me with his teeth;
b.JOB.1.7	And the Lord said vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? Then Satan answered the
b.JOB.17.1	My breath is corrupt, my dayes are extinct, the graues are ready for me.
b.JOB.17.10	But as for you all, doe you returne, and come now, for I cannot find one wise
b.JOB.17.11	My dayes are past, my purposes are broken off, euen the thoughts of my heart:
b.JOB.17.12	They change the night into day: the light is short, because of darknes.
b.JOB.17.13	If I waite, the graue is mine house: I haue made my bedde in the darknesse.
b.JOB.17.14	I haue said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worme, Thou art my
b.JOB.17.15	And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
b.JOB.17.16	They shall goe downe to the barres of the pit, when our rest together is in
b.JOB.17.2	Are there not mockers with mee? and doeth not mine eye continue in their
b.JOB.17.3	Lay downe now, put me in a suretie with thee; who is he that will strike hands
b.JOB.17.4	For thou hast hid their heart from vnderstanding: therefore shalt thou not
b.JOB.17.5	Hee that speaketh flattery to his friends, euen the eyes of his children shall
b.JOB.17.6	He hath made me also a by-word of the people, and afore time I was as a tabret.
b.JOB.17.7	Mine eye also is dimme by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a
b.JOB.17.8	Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stirre vp
b.JOB.17.9	The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath cleane hands shalbe
b.JOB.1.8	And the Lord sayd vnto Satan, Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there
b.JOB.18.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said,
b.JOB.18.10	The snare is laide for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
b.JOB.18.11	Terrours shall make him afraid on euery side, and shall driue him to his
b.JOB.18.12	His strength shalbe hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his
b.JOB.18.13	It shall deuoure the strength of his skinne: euen the first borne of death
b.JOB.18.14	His confidence shalbe rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to
b.JOB.18.15	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall
b.JOB.18.16	His rootes shall be dryed vp beneath: and aboue shall his branch be cut off.
b.JOB.18.17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and hee shall haue no name in
b.JOB.18.18	He shall be driuen from light into darkenesse, and chased out of the world.
b.JOB.18.19	Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining
b.JOB.18.2	How long will it bee, ere you make an ende of words? Marke, and afterwards we
b.JOB.18.20	They that come after him shalbe astonied at his day, as they that went
b.JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him
b.JOB.18.3	Wherefore are wee counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
b.JOB.18.4	He teareth himselfe in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and
b.JOB.18.5	Yea, the light of the wicked shalbe put out, and the sparke of his fire shall
b.JOB.18.6	The light shalbe darke in his tabernacle, and his candle shalbe put out with
b.JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his owne counsell shall
b.JOB.18.8	For hee is cast into a net by his owne feete, &amp; he walketh vpon a snare.
b.JOB.18.9	The grinne shall take him by the heele, and the robber shall preuaile against
b.JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered ye Lord, and sayd, Doeth Iob feare God for nought?
b.JOB.19.1	Then Iob answered, and sayd,
b.JOB.19.10	He hath destroyed me on euery side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he
b.JOB.19.11	He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and hee counteth me vnto him as
b.JOB.19.12	His troupes come together, and raise vp their way against me, and encampe
b.JOB.19.13	Hee hath put my brethren farre from me, and mine acquaintance are verely
b.JOB.19.14	My kinsefolke haue failed, and my familiar friends haue forgotten me.
b.JOB.19.15	They that dwell in mine house, and my maides count me for a stranger: I am an
b.JOB.19.16	I called my seruant, and he gaue me no answere: I intreated him with my
b.JOB.19.17	My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the childrens sake of
b.JOB.19.18	Yea, yong children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
b.JOB.19.19	All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loued, are turned against
b.JOB.19.2	How long will yee vexe my soule, and breake me in pieces with words?
b.JOB.19.20	My bone cleaueth to my skinne, and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the
b.JOB.19.21	Haue pity vpon me, haue pitie vpon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God
b.JOB.19.22	Why doe ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
b.JOB.19.23	Oh that my wordes were now written, oh that they were printed in a booke!
b.JOB.19.24	That they were grauen with an iron pen and lead, in the rocke for euer.
b.JOB.19.25	For I know that my Redeemer liueth, and that he shall stand at the latter
b.JOB.19.26	And though after my skin, wormes destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I
b.JOB.19.27	Whom I shal see for my selfe, and mine eyes shall beholde, and not another,
b.JOB.19.28	But ye should say, Why persecute we him? seeing the root of the matter is
b.JOB.19.29	Bee ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword,
b.JOB.19.3	These tenne times haue ye reproched me: you are not ashamed that you make your
b.JOB.19.4	And be it indeed that I haue erred, mine errour remaineth with my selfe.
b.JOB.19.5	If indeed yee will magnifie your selues against me, and plead against me my
b.JOB.19.6	Know now that God hath ouerthrowen me, and hath compassed me with his net.
b.JOB.19.7	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloude, but there is no
b.JOB.19.8	Hee hath fenced vp my way that I cannot passe; and hee hath set darkenesse in
b.JOB.19.9	Hee hath stript me of my glory, and taken the crowne from my head.
b.JOB.20.1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and saide,
b.JOB.20.10	His children shall seeke to please the poore, and his hands shall restore
b.JOB.20.11	His bones are ful of the sinne of his youth, which shall ye downe with him in
b.JOB.20.12	Though wickednes be sweet in his mouth, though hee hide it vnder his tongue;
b.JOB.20.13	Though he spare it, and forsake it not, but keepe it stil within his mouth:
b.JOB.20.14	Yet his meate in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of Aspes within him.
b.JOB.20.15	He hath swallowed downe riches, and hee shall vomite them vp againe: God
b.JOB.20.16	He shall sucke the poison of Aspes: the vipers tongue shall slay him.
b.JOB.20.17	Hee shall not see the riuers, the floods, the brookes of hony and butter.
b.JOB.20.18	That which he laboured for, shall he restore, &amp; shall not swallow it
b.JOB.20.19	Because hee hath oppressed, and hath forsaken the poore; because he hath
b.JOB.20.2	Therefore doe my thoughts cause mee to answere, and for this I make haste.
b.JOB.20.20	Surely he shall not feele quietnesse in his belly, hee shall not saue of that
b.JOB.20.21	There shall none of his meat be left, therefore shall no man looke for his
b.JOB.20.22	In the fulnesse of his sufficiencie, he shalbe in straites: euery hand of the
b.JOB.20.23	When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the furie of his wrath
b.JOB.20.24	He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steele shall strike him
b.JOB.20.25	It is drawen, and commeth out of the body; yea the glistering sword commeth
b.JOB.20.26	All darknesse shalbe hid in his secret places: a fire not blowen shall
b.JOB.20.27	The heauen shall reueale his iniquitie: and the earth shall rise vp against
b.JOB.20.28	The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the
b.JOB.20.29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed vnto
b.JOB.20.3	I haue heard the checke of my reproach, and the spirit of my vnderstanding
b.JOB.20.4	Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed vpon earth,
b.JOB.20.5	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the ioy of the hypocrite but
b.JOB.20.6	Though his excellencie mount vp to the heauens, and his head reach vnto the
b.JOB.20.7	Yet he shall perish for euer, like his owne doung: they which haue seene him,
b.JOB.20.8	He shall flie away as a dreame, and shall not be found: yea he shalbe chased
b.JOB.20.9	The eye also which saw him, shall see him no more; neither shall his place any
b.JOB.2.1	Againe there was a day when the sonnes of God came to present themselues
b.JOB.2.10	But he said vnto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh;
b.JOB.2.11	Now when Iobs three friends heard of all this euill, that was come vpon him,
b.JOB.21.1	But Iob answered, and sayd,
b.JOB.21.10	Their bull gendreth and faileth not, their cow calueth, and casteth not her
b.JOB.21.11	They send foorth their little ones like a flocke, and their children dance.
b.JOB.21.12	They take the timbrell and harpe, and reioyce at the sound of the organe.
b.JOB.21.13	They spend their daies in wealth, and in a moment goe downe to the graue.
b.JOB.21.14	Therefore they say vnto God, Depart from vs: for we desire not the knowledge
b.JOB.21.15	What is the Almightie, that wee should serue him? and what profite should we
b.JOB.21.16	Loe, their good is not in their hand, the counsell of the wicked is farre
b.JOB.21.17	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and how oft commeth their
b.JOB.21.18	They are as stubble before the winde, and as chaffe that the storme carieth
b.JOB.21.19	God layeth vp his iniquitie for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall
b.JOB.2.12	And when they lift vp their eyes afarre off, and knew him not, they lifted vp
b.JOB.21.2	Heare diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
b.JOB.21.20	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drinke of the wrath of the
b.JOB.21.21	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his
b.JOB.21.22	Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he iudgeth those that are high.
b.JOB.21.23	One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
b.JOB.21.24	His breasts are full of milke, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
b.JOB.21.25	And another dieth in the bitternesse of his soule, and neuer eateth with
b.JOB.21.26	They shall lie downe alike in the dust, and the wormes shall couer them.
b.JOB.21.27	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the deuices which yee wrongfully imagine
b.JOB.21.28	For ye say, where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling
b.JOB.21.29	Haue ye not asked them that goe by the way? and doe ye not know their tokens?
b.JOB.2.13	So they sate downe with him vpon the ground seuen dayes, and seuen nights,
b.JOB.21.3	Suffer me that I may speake, and after that I haue spoken, mocke on.
b.JOB.21.30	That the wicked is reserued to the day of destruction; they shall bee brought
b.JOB.21.31	Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath
b.JOB.21.32	Yet shall hee be brought to the graue, &amp; shall remaine in the tombe.
b.JOB.21.33	The cloudes of the valley shalbe sweete vnto him, and euery man shall draw
b.JOB.21.34	How then comfort ye me in vaine, seeing in your answeres there remaineth
b.JOB.21.4	As for mee, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my
b.JOB.21.5	Marke mee, and be astonished, and lay your hand vpon your mouth.
b.JOB.21.6	Euen when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh holde on my flesh.
b.JOB.21.7	Wherefore doe the wicked liue, become old, yea, are mightie in power?
b.JOB.21.8	Their seede is established in their sight with them, and their offspring
b.JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from feare, neither is the rod of God vpon them.
b.JOB.2.2	And the Lord said vnto Satan, From whence commest thou? And Satan answered the
b.JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,
b.JOB.22.10	Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden feare troubleth thee,
b.JOB.22.11	Or darkenes that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters couer thee.
b.JOB.22.12	Is not God in the height of heauen? and behold the height of the starres how
b.JOB.22.13	And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he iudge through the darke cloude?
b.JOB.22.14	Thicke cloudes are a couering to him that he seeth not, and hee walketh in
b.JOB.22.15	Hast thou marked the olde way which wicked men haue troden?
b.JOB.22.16	Which were cut downe out of time, whose foundation was ouerflowen with a
b.JOB.22.17	Which said vnto God, Depart from vs, and what can the Almightie doe for them?
b.JOB.22.18	Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsell of the wicked
b.JOB.22.19	The righteous see it, and are glad, and the innocent laugh them to scorne.
b.JOB.22.2	Can a man be profitable vnto God? as hee that is wise may be profitable vnto
b.JOB.22.20	Whereas our substance is not cut downe, but the remnant of them the fire
b.JOB.22.21	Acquaint now thy selfe with him, and be at peace: thereby good shal come vnto
b.JOB.22.22	Receiue, I pray thee, the Lawe from his mouth, and lay vp his words in thine
b.JOB.22.23	If thou returne to the Almightie, thou shalt be built vp, thou shalt put away
b.JOB.22.24	Then shalt thou lay vp golde as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of
b.JOB.22.25	Yea the Almightie shall bee thy defence, and thou shalt haue plenty of siluer.
b.JOB.22.26	For then shalt thou haue thy delight in the Almightie, and shalt lift vp thy
b.JOB.22.27	Thou shalt make thy prayer vnto him, and he shall heare thee, and thou shalt
b.JOB.22.28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shal be established vnto thee: and the
b.JOB.22.29	When men are cast downe, then thou shalt say, There is lifting vp: and he
b.JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gaine to
b.JOB.22.30	He shall deliuer the Iland of the innocent: and it is deliuered by the
b.JOB.22.4	Will hee reproue thee for feare of thee? will he enter with thee into iudgment?
b.JOB.22.5	Is not thy wickednesse great? and thine iniquities infinite?
b.JOB.22.6	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the
b.JOB.22.7	Thou hast not giuen water to the wearie to drinke, and thou hast withholden
b.JOB.22.8	But as for the mightie man, hee had the earth, and the honourable man dwelt in
b.JOB.22.9	Thou hast sent widowes away emptie, and the armes of the fatherlesse haue bene
b.JOB.2.3	And the Lord said vnto Satan, Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there
b.JOB.23.1	Then Iob answered, and said,
b.JOB.23.10	But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth
b.JOB.23.11	My foot hath held his steps, his way haue I kept, and not declined.
b.JOB.23.12	Neither haue I gone backe from the commaundement of his lippes, I haue
b.JOB.23.13	But hee is in one minde, and who can turne him? and what his soule desireth,
b.JOB.23.14	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for mee: and many such things
b.JOB.23.15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
b.JOB.23.16	For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
b.JOB.23.17	Because I was not cut off before the darknes, neither hath he couered the
b.JOB.23.2	Euen to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heauier then my groning.
b.JOB.23.3	O that I knewe where I might find him! that I might come euen to his seate!
b.JOB.23.4	I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
b.JOB.23.5	I would know the words which he would answere me, and vnderstand what he would
b.JOB.23.6	Will he plead against me with his great power? No, but hee would put strength
b.JOB.23.7	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be deliuered for euer
b.JOB.23.8	Behold, I goe forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot
b.JOB.23.9	On the left hand where hee doeth worke, but I cannot behold him: he hideth
b.JOB.2.4	And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skinne for skinne, yea all that a man
b.JOB.24.1	Why, seeing Times are not hidden from the Almightie, doe they, that know him
b.JOB.24.10	They cause him to go naked without clothing: and they take away the sheafe
b.JOB.24.11	Which make oyle within their walles, and tread their winepresses, and suffer
b.JOB.24.12	Men groane from out of the city, and the soule of the wounded crieth out: yet
b.JOB.24.13	They are of those that rebell against the light, they know not the wayes
b.JOB.24.14	The murderer rising with the light, killeth the poore and needy, and in the
b.JOB.24.15	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall
b.JOB.24.16	In the darke they digge through houses which they had marked for themselues
b.JOB.24.17	For the morning is to them euen as the shadow of death: if one know them,
b.JOB.24.18	Hee is swift as the waters, their portion is cursed in the earth: he
b.JOB.24.19	Drought and heate consume the snow waters: so doeth the graue those which
b.JOB.24.2	Some remooue the land-markes; they violently take away flocks, and feed
b.JOB.24.20	The wombe shall forget him, the worme shall feed sweetly on him, hee shall be
b.JOB.24.21	He euill intreateth the barren, that beareth not: and doeth not good to the
b.JOB.24.22	He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth vp, and no man is sure
b.JOB.24.23	Though it be giuen him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are
b.JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a litle while, but are gone and brought low, they are
b.JOB.24.25	And if it be not so now, who will make mee a liar, and make my speach nothing
b.JOB.24.3	They driue away the asse of the fatherlesse, they take the widowes oxe for a
b.JOB.24.4	They turne the needy out of the way: the poore of the earth hide themselues
b.JOB.24.5	Behold, as wilde asses in the desart, goe they foorth to their worke, rising
b.JOB.24.6	They reape euery one his corne in the fielde: and they gather the vintage of
b.JOB.24.7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they haue no couering in
b.JOB.24.8	They are wet with the showres of the mountaines, and imbrace the rocke for
b.JOB.24.9	They plucke the fatherlesse from the brest, and take a pledge of the poore.
b.JOB.2.5	But put foorth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will
b.JOB.25.1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
b.JOB.25.2	Dominion and feare are with him, hee maketh peace in his high places.
b.JOB.25.3	Is there any number of his armies? and vpon whom doeth not his light arise?
b.JOB.25.4	How then can man bee iustified with God? or how can he be cleane that is borne
b.JOB.25.5	Behold euen to the moone, and it shineth not, yea the starres are not pure in
b.JOB.25.6	How much lesse man, that is a worme: and the sonne of man which is a worme?
b.JOB.2.6	And the Lord said vnto Satan, Behold, hee is in thine hand, but saue his life.
b.JOB.26.1	But Iob answered and sayd,
b.JOB.26.10	Hee hath compassed the waters with bounds, vntill the day and night come to
b.JOB.26.11	The pillars of heauen tremble, and are astonished at his reproofe.
b.JOB.26.12	Hee diuideth the sea with his power, and by his vnderstanding he smiteth
b.JOB.26.13	By his spirit he hath garnished the heauens; his hand hath formed the crooked
b.JOB.26.14	Loe, these are parts of his waies, but how little a portion is heard of him?
b.JOB.26.2	Howe hast thou helped him that is without power? how sauest thou the arme that
b.JOB.26.3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisedome? and how hast thou
b.JOB.26.4	To whom hast thou vttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
b.JOB.26.5	Dead things are formed from vnder the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
b.JOB.26.6	Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no couering.
b.JOB.26.7	He stretcheth out the North ouer the emptie place, and hangeth the earth vpon
b.JOB.26.8	Hee bindeth vp the waters in his thicke clouds, and the cloud is not rent
b.JOB.26.9	Hee holdeth backe the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud vpon it.
b.JOB.2.7	So went Satan foorth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Iob with sore
b.JOB.27.1	Moreouer Iob continued his parable, and sayd,
b.JOB.27.10	Will he delight himselfe in the Almightie? will hee alwayes call vpon God?
b.JOB.27.11	I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almightie, will I
b.JOB.27.12	Behold, all ye your selues haue seene it, why then are yee thus altogether
b.JOB.27.13	This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressours
b.JOB.27.14	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offpring shall
b.JOB.27.15	Those that remaine of him shall bee buried in death: and his widowes shall
b.JOB.27.16	Though he heape vp siluer as the dust, and prepare rayment as the clay:
b.JOB.27.17	He may prepare it, but the iust shall put it on, and the innocent shall
b.JOB.27.18	He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
b.JOB.27.19	The rich man shall lie downe, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his
b.JOB.27.2	As God liueth, who hath taken away my iudgment, and the Almighty, who hath
b.JOB.27.20	Terrours take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the
b.JOB.27.21	The East winde carieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storme hurleth
b.JOB.27.22	For God shall cast vpon him, and not spare: hee would faine flee out of his
b.JOB.27.23	Men shall clap their handes at him, and shall hisse him out of his place.
b.JOB.27.3	All the while my breath is in mee, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
b.JOB.27.4	My lips shall not speake wickednesse, nor my tongue vtter deceit.
b.JOB.27.5	God forbid that I should iustifie you: till I die, I will not remoue my
b.JOB.27.6	My righteousnesse I hold fast, and will not let it goe: my heart shall not
b.JOB.27.7	Let mine enemie be as the wicked, and he that riseth vp against me, as the
b.JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh
b.JOB.27.9	Will God heare his cry, when trouble commeth vpon him?
b.JOB.2.8	And hee tooke him a potsheard to scrape himselfe withall; and hee sate downe
b.JOB.28.1	Surely there is a veine for the siluer, and a place for golde where they fine
b.JOB.28.10	Hee cutteth out riuers among the rockes, and his eye seeth euery precious
b.JOB.28.11	He bindeth the flouds from ouerflowing, and the thing that is hid, bringeth
b.JOB.28.12	But where shall wisedome bee found? And where is the place of vnderstanding?
b.JOB.28.13	Man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the
b.JOB.28.14	The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
b.JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for golde, neither shall siluer be weighed for the price
b.JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued with the golde of Ophir, with the precious Onix, or the
b.JOB.28.17	The golde and the chrystall cannot equall it: and the exchange of it shall
b.JOB.28.18	No mention shalbe made of Corall, or of Pearles: for the price of wisedome is
b.JOB.28.19	The Topaze of Ethiopia shall not equall it, neither shall it be valued with
b.JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the earth, and brasse is molten out of the stone.
b.JOB.28.20	Whence then commeth wisedome? and where is the place of vnderstanding?
b.JOB.28.21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all liuing, and kept close from the foules
b.JOB.28.22	Destruction and death say, Wee haue heard the fame thereof with our eares.
b.JOB.28.23	God vnderstandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
b.JOB.28.24	For hee looketh to the endes of the earth, and seeth vnder the whole heauen:
b.JOB.28.25	To make the weight for the windes, and he weigheth the waters by measure.
b.JOB.28.26	When hee made a decree for the raine, and a way for the lightning of the
b.JOB.28.27	Then did he see it, and declare it, he prepared it, yea and searched it out.
b.JOB.28.28	And vnto man he said, Behold, the feare of the Lord, that is wisedome, and to
b.JOB.28.3	Hee setteth an ende to darkenesse, and searcheth out all perfection: the
b.JOB.28.4	The floud breaketh out from the inhabitant; euen the waters forgotten of the
b.JOB.28.5	As for the earth, out of it commeth bread: and vnder it, is turned vp as it
b.JOB.28.6	The stones of it are the place of Saphires: and it hath dust of golde.
b.JOB.28.7	There is a path which no foule knoweth, and which the vulturs eye hath not
b.JOB.28.8	The lyons whelps haue not troden it, nor the fierce lyon passed by it.
b.JOB.28.9	Hee putteth foorth his hand vpon the rocke; hee ouerturneth the mountaines by
b.JOB.2.9	Then saide his wife vnto him, Doest thou still reteine thine integritie? Curse
b.JOB.29.1	Moreouer Iob continued his parable, and said,
b.JOB.29.10	The Nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaued to the roofe of their
b.JOB.29.11	When the eare heard mee, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it gaue
b.JOB.29.12	Because I deliuered the poore that cried, and the fatherlesse, and him that
b.JOB.29.13	The blessing of him that was readie to perish, came vpon me: and I caused the
b.JOB.29.14	I put on righteousnesse, and it clothed me: my iudgement was as a robe and a
b.JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
b.JOB.29.16	I was a father to the poore: and the cause which I knewe not, I searched out.
b.JOB.29.17	And I brake the iawes of the wicked, and pluckt the spoile out of his teeth.
b.JOB.29.18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiplie my dayes as the
b.JOB.29.19	My roote was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night vpon my
b.JOB.29.2	O that I were as in moneths past, as in the dayes when God preserued me.
b.JOB.29.20	My glory was fresh in mee, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
b.JOB.29.21	Unto me men gaue eare, and waited, and kept silence at my counsell.
b.JOB.29.22	After my words they spake not againe, &amp; my speach dropped vpon them,
b.JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the raine, and they opened their mouth wide as
b.JOB.29.24	If I laughed on them, they beleeued it not, and the light of my countenance
b.JOB.29.25	I chose out their way, and sate chiefe, and dwelt as a king in the army, as
b.JOB.29.3	When his candle shined vpon my head, and when by his light I walked through
b.JOB.29.4	As I was in the dayes of my youth, when the secret of God was vpon my
b.JOB.29.5	When the Almightie was yet with me, when my children were about me:
b.JOB.29.6	When I washed my steps with butter, and the rocke powred me out riuers of oyle:
b.JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate, through the citie, when I prepared my seate in
b.JOB.29.8	The yong men saw me, and hid themselues: and the aged arose, and stood vp.
b.JOB.29.9	The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
b.JOB.30.1	But nowe they that are yonger then I, haue mee in derision, whose fathers I
b.JOB.30.10	They abhorre me, they flee farre from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
b.JOB.30.11	Because hee hath loosed my cord and afflicted me, they haue also let loose
b.JOB.30.12	Upon my right hand rise the youth, they push away my feete, and they raise vp
b.JOB.30.13	They marre my path, they set forward my calamitie, they haue no helper.
b.JOB.30.14	They came vpon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they
b.JOB.30.15	Terrours are turned vpon mee: they pursue my soule as the wind: and my
b.JOB.30.16	And now my soule is powred out vpon me: the dayes of affliction haue taken
b.JOB.30.17	My bones are pierced in mee in the night season: and my sinewes take no rest.
b.JOB.30.18	By the great force of my disease, is my garment changed: it bindeth mee about
b.JOB.30.19	He hath cast mee into the myre, and I am become like dust and ashes.
b.JOB.30.2	Yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom olde age was
b.JOB.30.20	I crie vnto thee, and thou doest not heare me: I stand vp, and thou regardest
b.JOB.30.21	Thou art become cruell to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thy selfe
b.JOB.30.22	Thou liftest me vp to the wind: thou causest me to ride vpon it, and
b.JOB.30.23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for
b.JOB.30.24	Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the graue, though they cry in his
b.JOB.30.25	Did not I weepe for him that was in trouble? was not my soule grieued for the
b.JOB.30.26	When I looked for good, then euill came vnto mee: and when I waited for
b.JOB.30.27	My bowels boyled and rested not: the dayes of affliction preuented mee.
b.JOB.30.28	I went mourning without the Sunne: I stood vp, and I cried in the
b.JOB.30.29	I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owles.
b.JOB.30.3	For want and famine they were solitarie: flying into the wildernesse in former
b.JOB.30.30	My skinne is blacke vpon mee, and my bones are burnt with heat.
b.JOB.30.31	My harpe also is turned to mourning, and my organe into the voyce of them
b.JOB.30.4	Who cut vp mallowes by the bushes, and Iuniper rootes for their meate.
b.JOB.30.5	They were driuen foorth from among men, (they cried after them, as after a
b.JOB.30.6	To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caues of the earth, and in the
b.JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they brayed: vnder the nettles they were gathered together.
b.JOB.30.8	They were children of fooles, yea children of base men: they were viler then
b.JOB.30.9	And now am I their song, yea I am their by-word.
b.JOB.3.1	After this, opened Iob his mouth, and cursed his day.
b.JOB.3.10	Because it shut not vp the doores of my mothers wombe, nor hid sorrowe from
b.JOB.3.11	Why died I not from the wombe? why did I not giue vp the ghost when I came
b.JOB.31.1	I made a couenant with mine eyes; why then should I thinke vpon a mayd?
b.JOB.31.10	Then let my wife grind vnto another, and let others bow downe vpon her.
b.JOB.31.11	For this is an heinous crime, yea, it is an iniquitie to bee punished by the
b.JOB.31.12	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would roote out all mine
b.JOB.31.13	If I did despise the cause of my man-seruant, or of my mayd-seruant, when
b.JOB.31.14	What then shall I do, when God riseth vp? and when hee visiteth, what shall I
b.JOB.31.15	Did not hee that made mee in the wombe, make him? and did not one fashion vs
b.JOB.31.16	If I haue withhelde the poore from their desire, or haue caused the eyes of
b.JOB.31.17	Or haue eaten my morsell my selfe alone, and the fatherlesse hath not eaten
b.JOB.31.18	(For from my youth hee was brought vp with me as with a father, and I haue
b.JOB.31.19	If I haue seene any perish for want of cloathing, or any poore without
b.JOB.3.12	Why did the knees preuent mee? or why the breasts, that I should sucke?
b.JOB.31.2	For what portion of God is there from aboue? and what inheritance of the
b.JOB.31.20	If his loynes haue not blessed me, and if hee were not warmed with the fleece
b.JOB.31.21	If I haue lift vp my hand against the fatherlesse, when I saw my helpe in the
b.JOB.31.22	Then let mine arme fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arme be broken from
b.JOB.31.23	For destruction from God was a terrour to mee: and by reason of his highnesse,
b.JOB.31.24	If I haue made golde my hope, or haue said to the fine gold, Thou art my
b.JOB.31.25	If I reioyced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten
b.JOB.31.26	If I beheld the Sunne when it shined, or the Moone walking in brightnesse:
b.JOB.31.27	And my heart hath bene secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
b.JOB.31.28	This also were an iniquitie to be punished by the Iudge: For I should haue
b.JOB.31.29	If I reioyced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lift vp my selfe
b.JOB.3.13	For now should I haue lien still and beene quiet, I should haue slept; then
b.JOB.31.3	Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of
b.JOB.31.30	(Neither haue I suffered my mouth to sinne by wishing a curse to his soule.)
b.JOB.31.31	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! wee cannot
b.JOB.31.32	The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doores to the
b.JOB.31.33	If I couered my transgressions, as Adam: by hiding mine iniquitie in my
b.JOB.31.34	Did I feare a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrifie me:
b.JOB.31.35	O that one would heare me! beholde, my desire is, that the Almightie would
b.JOB.31.36	Surely I would take it vpon my shoulder, and bind it as a crowne to me.
b.JOB.31.37	I would declare vnto him the number of my steps, as a prince would I goe
b.JOB.31.38	If my land cry against me, or that the furrowes likewise thereof complaine:
b.JOB.31.39	If I haue eaten the fruits thereof without money, or haue caused the owners
b.JOB.3.14	With Kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for
b.JOB.31.4	Doeth not he see my wayes, and count all my steps?
b.JOB.31.40	Let thistles grow in stead of wheat, and cockle in stead of barley. The words
b.JOB.3.15	Or with Princes that had golde, who filled their houses with siluer:
b.JOB.31.5	If I haue walked with vanitie, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
b.JOB.3.16	Or as an hidden vntimely birth, I had not bene; as infants which neuer saw
b.JOB.31.6	Let me bee weighed in an euen ballance, that God may know mine integritie.
b.JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from troubling: and there the wearie be at rest.
b.JOB.31.7	If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes,
b.JOB.3.18	There the prisoners rest together, they heare not the voice of the oppressour.
b.JOB.31.8	Then let mee sow, and let another eate, yea let my off-spring be rooted out.
b.JOB.3.19	The small and great are there, and the seruant is free from his master.
b.JOB.31.9	If mine heart haue bene deceiued by a woman, or if I haue layde wait at my
b.JOB.3.2	And Iob spake, and said,
b.JOB.3.20	Wherefore is light giuen to him that is in misery, and life vnto the bitter
b.JOB.3.21	Which long for death, but it commeth not, and dig for it more then for hid
b.JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answere Iob, because he was righteous in his owne
b.JOB.32.10	Therfore I sayd, Hearken to me: I also will shew mine opinion.
b.JOB.32.11	Behold, I waited for your words: I gaue eare to your reasons, whilest you
b.JOB.32.12	Yea, I attended vnto you: and beholde, there was none of you that conuinced
b.JOB.32.13	Lest ye should say, We haue found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not
b.JOB.32.14	Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answere him
b.JOB.32.15	They were amased, they answered no more, they left off speaking.
b.JOB.32.16	When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still and answered no
b.JOB.32.17	I sayd, I will answere also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
b.JOB.32.18	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
b.JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly is as wine, which hath no vent, it is ready to burst like
b.JOB.3.22	Which reioice exceedingly, and are glad when they can finde the graue?
b.JOB.32.2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu, the sonne of Barachel the Buzite, of the
b.JOB.32.20	I will speake, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lippes, and answere.
b.JOB.32.21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any mans person: neither let me giue
b.JOB.32.22	For I know not to giue flattering titles: in so doing my maker would soone
b.JOB.3.23	Why is light giuen to a man, whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
b.JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled: because they had found
b.JOB.3.24	For my sighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like the
b.JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited till Iob had spoken: because they were elder then he.
b.JOB.3.25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come vpon me, and that which I was
b.JOB.32.5	When Elihu saw that there was no answere in the mouth of these three men, then
b.JOB.3.26	I was not in safetie, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet: yet trouble
b.JOB.32.6	And Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite answered and sayd: I am yong, and
b.JOB.32.7	I said, Dayes should speake, and multitude of yeeres should teach wisedome.
b.JOB.32.8	But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almightie giueth them
b.JOB.32.9	Great men are not alwayes wise: neither doe the aged vnderstand iudgement.
b.JOB.3.3	Let the day perish, wherein I was borne, and the night in which it was said,
b.JOB.33.1	Wherefore, Iob, I pray thee, heare my speeches, and hearken to all my wordes.
b.JOB.33.10	Behold, hee findeth occasions against mee, hee counteth mee for his enemie.
b.JOB.33.11	He putteth my feete in the stockes, he marketh all my pathes.
b.JOB.33.12	Behold, in this thou art not iust: I will answere thee, That God is greater
b.JOB.33.13	Why doest thou striue against him? for he giueth not account of any of his
b.JOB.33.14	For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiueth it not.
b.JOB.33.15	In a dreame, in a vision of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth vpon men, in
b.JOB.33.16	Then hee openeth the eares of men, and sealeth their instruction,
b.JOB.33.17	That hee may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
b.JOB.33.18	Hee keepeth backe his soule from the pit, and his life from perishing by the
b.JOB.33.19	Hee is chastened also with paine vpon his bed, and the multitude of his bones
b.JOB.33.2	Behold, now I haue opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
b.JOB.33.20	So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soule daintie meate.
b.JOB.33.21	His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seene; and his bones that were
b.JOB.33.22	His soule draweth neere vnto the graue, and his life to the destroyers.
b.JOB.33.23	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to
b.JOB.33.24	Then hee is gracious vnto him, and sayth, Deliuer him from going downe to the
b.JOB.33.25	His flesh shall be fresher then a childes: he shall returne to the dayes of
b.JOB.33.26	He shall pray vnto God, and hee will be fauourable vnto him, and hee shall
b.JOB.33.27	He looketh vpon men, and if any say, I haue sinned, and peruerted that which
b.JOB.33.28	Hee will deliuer his soule from going into the pit, and his life shall see
b.JOB.33.29	Loe, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
b.JOB.33.3	My words shalbe of the vprightnesse of my heart: and my lippes shall vtter
b.JOB.33.30	To bring backe his soule from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of
b.JOB.33.31	Marke well, O Iob, hearken vnto me, hold thy peace, and I wil speake.
b.JOB.33.32	If thou hast any thing to say, answere me: speake, for I desire to iustifie
b.JOB.33.33	If not, hearken vnto me: holde thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisedome.
b.JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me
b.JOB.33.5	If thou canst, answere me, set thy wordes in order before me, stand vp.
b.JOB.33.6	Behold, I am according to thy wish in Gods stead: I also am formed out of the
b.JOB.33.7	Behold, my terrour shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heauie
b.JOB.33.8	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I haue heard the voice of thy
b.JOB.33.9	I am cleane without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquitie
b.JOB.3.4	Let that day bee darkenesse, let not God regard it from aboue, neither let the
b.JOB.34.1	Furthermore Elihu answered, and said,
b.JOB.34.10	Therefore hearken vnto me, ye men of vnderstanding: farre bee it from God,
b.JOB.34.11	For the worke of a man shall he render vnto him, and cause euery man to finde
b.JOB.34.12	Yea surely God will not doe wickedly, neither will the Almighty peruert
b.JOB.34.13	Who hath giuen him a charge ouer the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole
b.JOB.34.14	If he set his heart vpon man, if he gather vnto himselfe his spirit and his
b.JOB.34.15	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turne againe vnto dust.
b.JOB.34.16	If now thou hast vnderstanding, heare this: hearken to the voyce of my words.
b.JOB.34.17	Shall euen he that hateth right, gouerne? and wilt thou condemne him that is
b.JOB.34.18	Is it fit to say to a King, Thou art wicked? and to Princes, Ye are vngodly?
b.JOB.34.19	How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of Princes, nor
b.JOB.34.2	Heare my wordes, O yee wise men, and giue eare vnto me, ye that haue
b.JOB.34.20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shalbe troubled at midnight, and
b.JOB.34.21	For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goings.
b.JOB.34.22	There is no darkenes, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquitie may
b.JOB.34.23	For hee will not lay vpon man more then right; that he should enter into
b.JOB.34.24	He shall breake in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their
b.JOB.34.25	Therefore hee knoweth their workes, and he ouerturneth them in the night, so
b.JOB.34.26	He striketh them as wicked men, in the open sight of others:
b.JOB.34.27	Because they turned backe from him, and would not consider any of his wayes.
b.JOB.34.28	So that they cause the cry of the poore to come vnto him, and he heareth the
b.JOB.34.29	When he giueth quietnesse, who then can make trouble? and when hee hideth his
b.JOB.34.3	For the eare trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meate.
b.JOB.34.30	That the hypocrite raigne not, lest the people be ensnared.
b.JOB.34.31	Surely it is meete to be said vnto God, I haue borne chastisement, I will not
b.JOB.34.32	That which I see not, teach thou me; If I haue done iniquitie, I will doe no
b.JOB.34.33	Should it bee according to thy minde? he will recompense it, whether thou
b.JOB.34.34	Let men of vnderstanding tell mee, and let a wise man hearken vnto mee.
b.JOB.34.35	Iob hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdome.
b.JOB.34.36	My desire is that Iob may bee tried vnto the ende, because of his answeres
b.JOB.34.37	For he addeth rebellion vnto his sinne, hee clappeth his handes amongst vs,
b.JOB.34.4	Let vs chuse to vs iudgement: let vs know among our selues what is good.
b.JOB.34.5	For Iob hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my iudgement.
b.JOB.34.6	Should I lye against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
b.JOB.34.7	What man is like Iob, who drinketh vp scorning like water?
b.JOB.34.8	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquitie, and walketh with wicked
b.JOB.34.9	For hee hath said, It profiteth a man nothing, that he should delight himselfe
b.JOB.3.5	Let darkenes and the shadowe of death staine it, let a cloud dwell vpon it,
b.JOB.35.1	Elihu spake moreouer, and said,
b.JOB.35.10	But none saith, where is God my maker, who giueth songs in the night?
b.JOB.35.11	Who teacheth vs more then the beasts of the earth, and maketh vs wiser then
b.JOB.35.12	There they crie, (but none giueth answere) because of the pride of euill men.
b.JOB.35.13	Surely God wil not heare vanitie, neither wil the Almightie regard it.
b.JOB.35.14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet iudgement is before him,
b.JOB.35.15	But now because it is not so, hee hath visited in his anger, yet he knoweth
b.JOB.35.16	Therefore doeth Iob open his mouth in vaine: he multiplieth words without
b.JOB.35.2	Thinkest thou this to bee right, that thou saydest, My righteousnesse is more
b.JOB.35.3	For thou saydst, what aduantage will it bee vnto thee, and, what profite shall
b.JOB.35.4	I will answere thee, and thy companions with thee.
b.JOB.35.5	Looke vnto the heauens and see, and behold the clouds which are higher then
b.JOB.35.6	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or it thy transgressions be
b.JOB.35.7	If thou be righteous, what giuest thou him? or what receiueth hee of thine
b.JOB.35.8	Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteousnesse may profit
b.JOB.35.9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to crie:
b.JOB.3.6	As for that night, let darkenesse seaze vpon it, let it not be ioyned vnto the
b.JOB.36.1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
b.JOB.36.10	He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth that they returne
b.JOB.36.11	If they obey and serue him, they shall spend their dayes in prosperitie, and
b.JOB.36.12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die
b.JOB.36.13	But the hypocrites in heart heape vp wrath: they crie not when he bindeth
b.JOB.36.14	They die in youth, and their life is among the vncleane.
b.JOB.36.15	He deliuereth the poore in his affliction, and openeth their eares in
b.JOB.36.16	Euen so would he haue remooued thee out of the strait into a broad place,
b.JOB.36.17	But thou hast fulfilled the iudgement of the wicked: iudgement and iustice
b.JOB.36.18	Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a
b.JOB.36.19	Will he esteeme thy riches? no not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
b.JOB.36.2	Suffer mee a little, and I will shewe thee, that I haue yet to speake on Gods
b.JOB.36.20	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
b.JOB.36.21	Take heed, regard not iniquitie: for this hast thou chosen rather then
b.JOB.36.22	Beholde, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
b.JOB.36.23	Who hath inioyned him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquitie?
b.JOB.36.24	Remember that thou magnifie his worke, which men behold.
b.JOB.36.25	Euery man may see it, man may behold it afarre off.
b.JOB.36.26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his
b.JOB.36.27	For hee maketh small the drops of water: they powre downe raine according to
b.JOB.36.28	Which the clouds doe drop, and distill vpon man aboundantly.
b.JOB.36.29	Also can any vnderstand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his
b.JOB.36.3	I will fetch my knowledge from afarre, and will ascribe righteousnesse to my
b.JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreadeth his light vpon it, and couereth the bottome of the sea.
b.JOB.36.31	For by them iudgeth he the people, he giueth meate in abundance.
b.JOB.36.32	With clouds he couereth the light, and commaundeth it not to shine, by the
b.JOB.36.33	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattel also concerning the
b.JOB.36.4	For truely my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge, is
b.JOB.36.5	Behold, God is mightie, and despiseth not any: he is mightie in strength and
b.JOB.36.6	He preserueth not the life of the wicked: but giueth right to the poore.
b.JOB.36.7	Hee withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on
b.JOB.36.8	And if they bee bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction:
b.JOB.36.9	Then hee sheweth them their worke, and their transgressions, that they haue
b.JOB.3.7	Loe, let that night be solitarie, let no ioyfull voice come therein.
b.JOB.37.1	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moued out of his place.
b.JOB.37.10	By the breath of God, frost is giuen: and the breadth of the waters is
b.JOB.37.11	Also by watring he wearieth the thicke cloud: hee scattereth his bright
b.JOB.37.12	And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may doe whatsoeuer
b.JOB.37.13	He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
b.JOB.37.14	Hearken vnto this, O Iob: stand still, and consider the wondrous workes of
b.JOB.37.15	Doest thou knowe when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to
b.JOB.37.16	Doest thou know the ballancings of the clouds, the wondrous workes of him
b.JOB.37.17	How thy garments are warme, when hee quieteth the earth by the South wind?
b.JOB.37.18	Hast thou with him spread out the skie, which is strong, and as a molten
b.JOB.37.19	Teach vs what we shall say vnto him; for we cannot order our speach by reason
b.JOB.37.2	Heare attentiuely the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his
b.JOB.37.20	Shall it bee told him that I speake? if a man speake, surely he shalbe
b.JOB.37.21	And nowe men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind
b.JOB.37.22	Faire weather commeth out of the North: with God is terrible maiestie.
b.JOB.37.23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and
b.JOB.37.24	Men doe therefore feare him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
b.JOB.37.3	Hee directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his lightning vnto the ends of
b.JOB.37.4	After it a voyce roareth: he thundreth with the voice of his excellencie, and
b.JOB.37.5	God thundereth maruellously with his voice: great things doth hee, which we
b.JOB.37.6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth: likewise to the small raine,
b.JOB.37.7	He sealeth vp the hand of euery man; that all men may knowe his worke.
b.JOB.37.8	Then the beastes goe into dennes: and remaine in their places.
b.JOB.37.9	Out of the South commeth the whirlewinde: and cold out of the North.
b.JOB.3.8	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise vp their
b.JOB.38.1	Then the Lord answered Iob out of the whirlewind, and sayd,
b.JOB.38.10	And brake vp for it my decreed place, and set barres and doores,
b.JOB.38.11	And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and heere shall thy proud
b.JOB.38.12	Hast thou commaunded the morning since thy daies? And caused the day-spring
b.JOB.38.13	That it might take hold of the endes of the earth, that the wicked might be
b.JOB.38.14	It is turned as clay to the seale, and they stand as a garment.
b.JOB.38.15	And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arme shalbe
b.JOB.38.16	Hast thou entred into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the
b.JOB.38.17	Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee? Or hast thou seene the doores
b.JOB.38.18	Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it all.
b.JOB.38.19	Where is the way where light dwelleth? And as for darknesse, where is the
b.JOB.38.2	Who is this that darkneth counsell by words without knowledge?
b.JOB.38.20	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest
b.JOB.38.21	Knowest thou it, because thou wast then borne? Or because the number of thy
b.JOB.38.22	Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snowe? Or hast thou seene the
b.JOB.38.23	Which I haue reserued against the time of trouble, against the day of
b.JOB.38.24	By what way is the light parted? Which scattereth the East wind vpon the
b.JOB.38.25	Who hath diuided a water-course for the ouerflowing of waters? Or a way for
b.JOB.38.26	To cause it to raine on the earth, where no man is: on the wildernesse
b.JOB.38.27	To satisfie the desolate and waste ground, and to cause the bud of the tender
b.JOB.38.28	Hath the raine a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
b.JOB.38.29	Out of whose wombe came the yce? And the hoary frost of heauen, who hath
b.JOB.38.3	Gird vp nowe thy loines like a man; for I will demaund of thee, and answere

b.JOB.40.5	Once haue I spoken, but I will not answere: yea twise, but I will proceed no

b.JOB.41.21	His breath kindleth coales, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
b.JOB.41.22	In his necke remaineth strength, and sorrowe is turned into ioy before him.
b.JOB.41.23	The flakes of his flesh are ioyned together: they are firme in themselues,

b.JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee: sling-stones are turned with him into
b.JOB.41.29	Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a speare.
b.JOB.4.13	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth on men:
b.JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications vnto thee? will he speake soft words vnto
b.JOB.41.30	Sharpe stones are vnder him: he spreadeth sharpe pointed things vpon the

b.JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like: who is made without feare.
b.JOB.41.34	He beholdeth all high things: he is a king ouer all the children of pride.
b.JOB.4.14	Feare came vpon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
b.JOB.41.4	Will he make a couenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a seruant for euer?
b.JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before my face: the haire of my flesh stood vp.
b.JOB.41.5	Wilt thou play with him as with a birde? wilt thou binde him for thy maydens?
b.JOB.4.16	It stood still, but I could not discerne the forme thereof: an image was
b.JOB.41.6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the

b.JOB.4.18	Behold, hee put no trust in his seruants; and his Angels hee charged with

b.JOB.4.19	Howe much lesse on them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in

b.JOB.4.20	They are destroyed from morning to euening: they perish for euer, without any

b.JOB.42.1	Then Iob answered the Lord, and said,
b.JOB.42.10	And the Lord turned the captiuitie of Iob, when he prayed for his friends:
b.JOB.42.11	Then came there vnto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they
b.JOB.42.12	So the Lord blessed the latter end of Iob, more then his beginning: for he
b.JOB.42.13	He had also seuen sonnes, and three daughters.
b.JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first, Iemima, and the name of the second,
b.JOB.42.15	And in all the land were no women found so faire as the daughters of Iob: and
b.JOB.42.16	After this liued Iob an hundred and fourtie yeeres, and saw his sonnes, and
b.JOB.42.17	So Iob died being old, and full of dayes.
b.JOB.42.2	I know that thou canst doe euery thing, and that no thought can bee withholden
b.JOB.42.3	Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore haue I vttered that
b.JOB.42.4	Heare, I beseech thee, and I will speake: I will demand of thee, and declare
b.JOB.42.5	I haue heard of thee by the hearing of the eare: but now mine eye seeth thee.
b.JOB.42.6	Wherefore I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes.
b.JOB.42.7	And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words vnto Iob, the Lord
b.JOB.42.8	Therefore take vnto you now seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes, and goe to my

b.JOB.5.1	Call now, if there be any that wil answere thee, and to which of the Saints
b.JOB.5.10	Who giueth raine vpon the earth, and sendeth waters vpon the fields:
b.JOB.5.11	To set vp on high those that be low; that those which mourne, may be exalted
b.JOB.5.12	Hee disappointeth the deuices of the craftie, so that their hands cannot
b.JOB.5.13	He taketh the wise in their owne craftinesse: and the counsell of the froward
b.JOB.5.14	They meete with darkenesse in the day time, and grope in the noone day as in
b.JOB.5.15	But he saueth the poore from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand
b.JOB.5.16	So the poore hath hope, and iniquitie stoppeth her mouth.
b.JOB.5.17	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the
b.JOB.5.18	For he maketh sore, and bindeth vp: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
b.JOB.5.19	Hee shall deliuer thee in sixe troubles, yea in seuen there shall no euill
b.JOB.5.2	For wrath killeth the foolish man, and enuy slayeth the silly one.
b.JOB.5.20	In famine he shall redeeme thee from death: and in warre from the power of
b.JOB.5.21	Thou shalt be hidde from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be
b.JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of
b.JOB.5.23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of
b.JOB.5.24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall bee in peace; and thou shalt
b.JOB.5.25	Thou shalt know also that thy seede shalbe great, and thine offspring as the
b.JOB.5.26	Thou shalt come to thy graue in a full age, like as a shocke of corne commeth
b.JOB.5.27	Loe this, wee haue searched it, so it is; heare it, and know thou it for thy

b.JOB.5.6	Although affliction commeth not forth of the dust, neither doeth trouble
b.JOB.5.7	Yet man is borne vnto trouble, as the sparkes flie vpward.
b.JOB.5.8	I would seeke vnto God, and vnto God would I commit my cause:
b.JOB.5.9	Which doth great things &amp; vnsearchable: marueilous things without number.
b.JOB.6.1	But Iob answered, and sayd,
b.JOB.6.10	Then should I yet haue comfort, yea I would harden my selfe in sorrow; let
b.JOB.6.11	What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine ende, that I should
b.JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse?
b.JOB.6.13	Is not my helpe in me? and is wisedome driuen quite from me?
b.JOB.6.14	To him that is afflicted, pitie should be shewed from his friend; But he
b.JOB.6.15	My brethren haue delt deceitfully as a brooke, &amp; as the streame of
b.JOB.6.16	Which are blackish by reason of the yce, and wherein the snow is hid:
b.JOB.6.17	What time they waxe warme, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out
b.JOB.6.18	The pathes of their way are turned aside; they goe to nothing, and perish.
b.JOB.6.19	The troupes of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
b.JOB.6.2	Oh that my griefe were throughly weighed, and my calamitie layd in the
b.JOB.6.20	They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were
b.JOB.6.21	For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting downe, and are afraid.
b.JOB.6.22	Did I say, Bring vnto mee? or giue a reward for me of your substance?
b.JOB.6.23	Or deliuer me from the enemies hand, or redeeme me from the hand of the
b.JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause mee to vnderstand wherein I
b.JOB.6.25	How forcible are right wordes? but what doeth your arguing reproue?
b.JOB.6.26	Do ye imagine to reproue words, and the speeches of one that is desperate,
b.JOB.6.27	Yea, ye ouerwhelme the fatherlesse, and you digge a pit for your friend.
b.JOB.6.28	Now therefore be content, looke vpon mee, for it is euident vnto you, if I
b.JOB.6.29	Returne, I pray you, let it not be iniquitie; yea returne againe: my
b.JOB.6.3	For now it would be heauier then the sand of the sea, therefore my words are
b.JOB.6.30	Is there iniquitie in my tongue? cannot my taste discerne peruerse things?
b.JOB.6.4	For the arrowes of the Almightie are within me, the poyson whereof drinketh vp
b.JOB.6.5	Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe ouer his

b.JOB.6.7	The things that my soule refused to touch, are as my sorrowfull meat.
b.JOB.6.8	O that I might haue my request! and that God would graunt mee the thing that I

b.JOB.7.1	Is there not an appointed time to man vpon earth? are not his dayes also like
b.JOB.7.10	Hee shall returne no more to his house: neither shall his place know him any
b.JOB.7.11	Therefore I will not refraine my mouth, I wil speake in the anguish of my
b.JOB.7.12	Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch ouer me?
b.JOB.7.13	When I say, My bed shal comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint:
b.JOB.7.14	Then thou skarest mee with dreames, and terrifiest me through visions.
b.JOB.7.15	So that my soule chooseth strangling: and death rather then my life.
b.JOB.7.16	I loath it, I would not liue alway: let me alone, for my dayes are vanitie.
b.JOB.7.17	What is man, that thou shouldest magnifie him? and that thou shouldest set
b.JOB.7.18	And that thou shouldest visite him euery morning, and trie him euery moment?
b.JOB.7.19	How long wilt thou not depart from me? nor let me alone till I swallow downe
b.JOB.7.2	As a seruant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the
b.JOB.7.20	I haue sinned, what shall I doe vnto thee, O thou preseruer of men? why hast
b.JOB.7.21	And why doest thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquitie?
b.JOB.7.3	So am I made to possesse moneths of vanitie, and wearisome nights are
b.JOB.7.4	When I lie downe, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am
b.JOB.7.5	My flesh is cloathed with wormes and clods of dust, my skinne is broken, and
b.JOB.7.6	My dayes are swifter then a weauers shuttle, and are spent without hope.
b.JOB.7.7	O remember that my life is winde: mine eye shall no more see good.
b.JOB.7.8	The eye of him that hath seene me, shall see mee no more: thine eyes are vpon
b.JOB.7.9	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth downe to the

b.JOB.8.10	Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, &amp; vtter words out of their

b.JOB.8.12	Whilest it is yet in his greennesse, and not cut downe, it withereth before
b.JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall
b.JOB.8.14	Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spiders web.
b.JOB.8.15	He shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand: he shal hold it fast,
b.JOB.8.16	He is greene before the sunne, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
b.JOB.8.17	His roots are wrapped about the heape, and seeth the place of stones.
b.JOB.8.18	If he destroy him from his place, then it shal denie him, saying, I haue not
b.JOB.8.19	Beholde, this is the ioy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
b.JOB.8.2	How long wilt thou speake these things? and how long shall the wordes of thy
b.JOB.8.20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will hee helpe the
b.JOB.8.21	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with reioycing.
b.JOB.8.22	They that hate thee shall be cloathed with shame, and the dwelling place of
b.JOB.8.3	Doth God peruert iudgement? or doth the Almightie peruert iustice?
b.JOB.8.4	If thy children haue sinned against him, and he haue cast them away for their

b.JOB.8.7	Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
b.JOB.8.8	For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thy selfe to the

b.JOB.9.10	Which doeth great things past finding out, yea and wonders without number.
b.JOB.9.11	Loe, hee goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceiue
b.JOB.9.12	Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say vnto him, What doest
b.JOB.9.13	If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers doe stoupe vnder him.
b.JOB.9.14	How much lesse shall I answere him, and choose out my words to reason with
b.JOB.9.15	Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answere, but I would make
b.JOB.9.16	If I had called, and had answered me, yet would I not beleeue that he had
b.JOB.9.17	For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
b.JOB.9.18	Hee will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitternesse.
b.JOB.9.19	If I speake of strength, loe, hee is strong: and if of iudgement, who shall
b.JOB.9.2	I know it is so of a trueth: but howe should man be iust with God.
b.JOB.9.20	If I iustifie my selfe, mine owne mouth shall condemne me: If I say, I am
b.JOB.9.21	Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soule: I would despise my
b.JOB.9.22	This is one thing, therefore I said it; he destroyeth the perfect and the
b.JOB.9.23	If the scourge slay suddenly, hee will laugh at the triall of the innocent.
b.JOB.9.24	The earth is giuen into the hand of the wicked: he couereth the faces of the
b.JOB.9.25	Now my dayes are swifter then a Poste: they flee away, they see no good.
b.JOB.9.26	They are passed away as the ships: as the Eagle that hasteth to the pray.
b.JOB.9.27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leaue off my heauinesse, and
b.JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my sorrowes, I know that thou wilt not holde me innocent.
b.JOB.9.29	If I be wicked, why then labour I in vaine?
b.JOB.9.3	If he will contend with him, he cannot answere him one of a thousand.
b.JOB.9.30	If I wash my selfe with snow water, and make my handes neuer so cleane:
b.JOB.9.31	Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine owne clothes shall abhorre
b.JOB.9.32	For he is not a man as I am, that I should answere him, and we should come
b.JOB.9.33	Neither is there any dayes-man betwixt vs, that might lay his hand vpon vs
b.JOB.9.34	Let him take his rodde away from me, &amp; let not his feare terrifie me:
b.JOB.9.35	Then would I speake, and not feare him; but it is not so with me.
b.JOB.9.4	He is wise in heart, and mightie in strength: who hath hardened himselfe

b.JOH.10.13	The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, &amp; careth not for the
b.JOH.10.14	I am the good shepheard, and know my sheepe, and am knowen of mine.
b.JOH.10.15	As the father knoweth me, euen so know I the father: &amp; I lay downe my

b.JOH.10.2	But hee that entreth in by the doore, is the shepherd of the sheepe.
b.JOH.10.20	And many of them said, He hath a deuill, and is mad, why heare ye him?
b.JOH.10.21	Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a deuill. Can a deuill
b.JOH.10.22	And it was at Hierusalem the feast of the dedication, &amp; it was winter.
b.JOH.10.23	And Iesus walked in the temple in Solomons porch.
b.JOH.10.24	Then came the Iewes round about him, and said vnto him, How long doest thou
b.JOH.10.25	Iesus answered them, I told you, and ye beleeued not: the workes that I doe
b.JOH.10.26	But ye beleeue not, because ye are not of my sheepe, as I said vnto you.
b.JOH.10.27	My sheepe heare my voyce, and I know them, and they follow me.
b.JOH.10.28	And I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish, neither
b.JOH.10.29	My father which gaue them me, is greater then all: and no man is able to

b.JOH.10.30	I and my father are one.
b.JOH.10.31	Then the Iewes tooke vp stones againe to stone him.
b.JOH.10.32	Iesus answered them, Many good workes haue I shewed you from my Father; for
b.JOH.10.33	The Iewes answered him, saying, For a good worke we stone thee not, but for
b.JOH.10.34	Iesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?
b.JOH.10.35	If hee called them gods, vnto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture
b.JOH.10.36	Say ye of him, whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou
b.JOH.10.37	If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue me not.
b.JOH.10.38	But if I doe, though yee beleeue not me, beleeue the works: that ye may know
b.JOH.10.39	Therefore they sought againe to take him: but hee escaped out of their hand,
b.JOH.10.4	And when he putteth foorth his owne sheepe, he goeth before them, and the
b.JOH.10.40	And went away againe beyond Iordane, into the place where Iohn at first
b.JOH.10.41	And many resorted vnto him, and said, Iohn did no miracle: but all things
b.JOH.10.42	And many beleeued on him there.
b.JOH.10.5	And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not
b.JOH.10.6	This parable spake Iesus vnto them: but they vnderstood not what things they
b.JOH.10.7	Then said Iesus vnto them againe, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, I am the
b.JOH.10.8	All that euer came before me, are theeues and robbers: but the sheepe did not
b.JOH.10.9	I am the doore by me if any man enter in, he shall be saued, and shall goe in
b.JOH.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, &amp; the Word was with God, and the Word was
b.JOH.1.10	Hee was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him
b.JOH.1.11	Hee came vnto his owne, and his owne receiued him not.
b.JOH.11.1	Now a certaine man was sicke, named Lazarus of Bethanie, the towne of Mary,
b.JOH.11.10	But if a man walke in the night, hee stumbleth, because there is no light in
b.JOH.11.11	These things said hee, and after that, hee saith vnto them, Our friend
b.JOH.11.12	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepe, he shall doe well.
b.JOH.11.13	Howbeit Iesus spake of his death: but they thought that hee had spoken of
b.JOH.11.14	Then saide Iesus vnto them plainly, Lazarus is dead:
b.JOH.11.15	And I am glad for your sakes, that I was not there (to the intent yee may
b.JOH.11.16	Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, vnto his fellow disciples, Let vs
b.JOH.11.17	Then when Iesus came, hee found that hee had lien in the graue foure dayes
b.JOH.11.18	(Now Bethanie was nigh vnto Hierusalem, about fifteene furlongs off:)
b.JOH.11.19	And many of the Iewes came to Martha, and Mary, to comfort them concerning
b.JOH.1.12	But as many as receiued him, to them gaue hee power to become the sonnes of
b.JOH.11.2	(It was that Mary which anoynted the Lord with oyntment, and wiped his feete
b.JOH.11.20	Then Martha, as soone as shee heard that Iesus was comming, went and met him:
b.JOH.11.21	Then saide Martha vnto Iesus, Lord, if thou hadst bene here, my brother had
b.JOH.11.22	But I know, that euen now, whatsoeuer thou wilt aske of God, God will giue it
b.JOH.11.23	Iesus saith vnto her, Thy brother shall rise againe.
b.JOH.11.24	Martha sayeth vnto him, I know that he shall rise againe in the resurrection
b.JOH.11.25	Iesus said vnto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: hee that beleeueth
b.JOH.11.26	And whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth in mee, shall neuer die. Beleeuest thou
b.JOH.11.27	She saith vnto him, Yea Lord, I beleeue that thou art the Christ the Sonne of
b.JOH.11.28	And when shee had so said, shee went her way, and called Mary her sister
b.JOH.11.29	Assoone as she heard that, she arose quickely, and came vnto him.
b.JOH.1.13	Which were borne, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
b.JOH.11.3	Therefore his sister sent vnto him, saying, Lord, behold, hee whom thou louest,
b.JOH.11.30	Now Iesus was not yet come into the towne, but was in that place where Martha
b.JOH.11.31	The Iewes then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they
b.JOH.11.32	Then when Mary was come where Iesus was, and saw him, shee fell downe at his
b.JOH.11.33	When Iesus therefore sawe her weeping, and the Iewes also weeping which came
b.JOH.11.34	And said, Where haue ye laid him? They say vnto him, Lord, come, &amp; see.
b.JOH.11.35	Iesus wept.
b.JOH.11.36	Then said the Iewes, Behold, how he loued him.
b.JOH.11.37	And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the
b.JOH.11.38	Iesus therefore againe groning in himselfe, commeth to the graue. It was a
b.JOH.11.39	Iesus said, Take yee away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead,
b.JOH.1.14	And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among vs (&amp; we beheld his glory,
b.JOH.11.4	When Iesus heard that, hee said, This sicknesse is not vnto death, but for the
b.JOH.11.40	Iesus saith vnto her, Said I not vnto thee, that if thou wouldst beleeue,
b.JOH.11.41	Then they tooke away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And
b.JOH.11.42	And I knewe that thou hearest me alwayes: but because of the people which
b.JOH.11.43	And when hee thus had spoken, he cryed with a loude voice, Lazarus, come
b.JOH.11.44	And he that was dead, came forth, bound hand &amp; foot with graue-clothes:
b.JOH.11.45	Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary, and had seene the things which
b.JOH.11.46	But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises, and tolde them what things
b.JOH.11.47	Then gathered ye chiefe Priests and the Pharises a councell, and said, What
b.JOH.11.48	If we let him thus alone, all men will beleeue on him, and the Romanes shall
b.JOH.11.49	And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high Priest that same yeere, said
b.JOH.1.15	Iohn bare witnesse of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He
b.JOH.11.5	Now Iesus loued Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
b.JOH.11.50	Nor consider that it is expedient for vs, that one man should die for the
b.JOH.11.51	And this spake he not of himselfe: but being high Priest that yeere, he
b.JOH.11.52	And not for that nation only, but that also hee should gather together in
b.JOH.11.53	Then from that day foorth, they tooke counsell together for to put him to
b.JOH.11.54	Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes: but went thence vnto a
b.JOH.11.55	And the Iewes Passeouer was nigh at hand, and many went out of the countrey
b.JOH.11.56	Then sought they for Iesus, and spake among themselues, as they stood in the
b.JOH.11.57	Now both the chiefe Priests and the Pharises had giuen a commandement, that
b.JOH.1.16	And of his fulnesse haue all wee receiued, and grace for grace.
b.JOH.11.6	When he had heard therefore that he was sicke, he abode two dayes still in the
b.JOH.1.17	For the Law was giuen by Moses, but grace and trueth came by Iesus Christ.
b.JOH.11.7	Then after that, saith hee to his disciples, Let vs go into Iudea againe.
b.JOH.1.18	No man hath seene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne, which is in the
b.JOH.11.8	His disciples say vnto him, Master, the Iewes of late sought to stone thee,
b.JOH.1.19	And this is the record of Iohn, when the Iewes sent Priests and Leuites from
b.JOH.11.9	Iesus answered, Are there not twelue houres in the day? If any man walke in
b.JOH.1.2	The same was in the beginning with God.
b.JOH.1.20	And he confessed, and denied not: but confessed, I am not the Christ.
b.JOH.1.21	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art
b.JOH.12.1	Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passouer, came to Bethanie, where Lazarus
b.JOH.12.10	But the chiefe Priests consulted, that they might put Lazarus also to death,
b.JOH.12.11	Because that by reason of him many of the Iewes went away and beleeued on
b.JOH.12.12	On the next day, much people that were come to the feast, when they heard
b.JOH.12.13	Tooke branches of Palme trees, and went foorth to meet him, and cried,
b.JOH.12.14	And Iesus, when he had found a yong asse, sate thereon, as it is written,
b.JOH.12.15	Feare not, daughter of Sion, behold, thy King commeth, sitting on an asses
b.JOH.12.16	These things vnderstood not his disciples at the first: but when Iesus was
b.JOH.12.17	The people therefore that was with him, when he called Lazarus out of his
b.JOH.12.18	For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that hee had done
b.JOH.12.19	The Pharisees therefore saide among themselues, Perceiue ye how yee preuaile
b.JOH.1.22	Then said they vnto him, Who art thou, that we may giue an answere to them
b.JOH.12.2	There they made him a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them
b.JOH.12.20	And there were certaine Greeks among them, that came vp to worship at the
b.JOH.12.21	The same came therefore to Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and
b.JOH.12.22	Philip commeth and telleth Andrew: and againe Andrew and Philip told Iesus.
b.JOH.12.23	And Iesus answered them, saying, The houre is come, that the Sonne of man
b.JOH.12.24	Uerely, verely, I say vnto you, Except a corne of wheat fall into the ground,
b.JOH.12.25	He that loueth his life, shall lose it: and hee that hateth his life in this
b.JOH.12.26	If any man serue me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my
b.JOH.12.27	Now is my soule troubled, and what shall I say? Father, saue me from this
b.JOH.12.28	Father, glorifie thy Name. Then came there a voice from heauen, saying, I
b.JOH.12.29	The people therefore that stood by, and heard it, said, that it thundered:
b.JOH.1.23	He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wildernesse: Make straight the
b.JOH.12.3	Then tooke Mary a pound of ointment, of Spikenard, very costly, and anointed
b.JOH.12.30	Iesus answered, and said, This voice came not because of mee, but for your
b.JOH.12.31	Now is the iudgement of this world: now shall the prince of this world be
b.JOH.12.32	And I, if I be lifted vp from the earth, will draw all men vnto me.
b.JOH.12.33	(This hee said, signifying what death he should die)
b.JOH.12.34	The people answered him, We haue heard out of the Law, that Christ abideth
b.JOH.12.35	Then Iesus said vnto them, Yet a little while is the light with you: walke
b.JOH.12.36	While ye haue light, beleeue in the light, that ye may bee the children of
b.JOH.12.37	But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they beleeued not on
b.JOH.12.38	That the saying of Esaias the Prophet might be fulfilled, which hee spake,
b.JOH.12.39	Therefore they could not beleeue, because that Esaias said againe,
b.JOH.1.24	And they which were sent, were of the Pharises.
b.JOH.12.4	Then saith one of his disciples, Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne, which should
b.JOH.12.40	He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart, that they should not see
b.JOH.12.41	These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
b.JOH.12.42	Neuerthelesse, among the chiefe rulers also, many beleeued on him; but
b.JOH.12.43	For they loued the praise of men, more then the praise of God.
b.JOH.12.44	Iesus cried, and said, He that beleeueth on me, beleeueth not on me, but on
b.JOH.12.45	And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
b.JOH.12.46	I am come a light into the world, that whosoeuer beleeueth on me, should not
b.JOH.12.47	And if any man heare my words, and beleeue not, I iudge him not; For I came
b.JOH.12.48	He that reiecteth me, and receiueth not my words, hath one that iudgeth him:
b.JOH.12.49	For I haue not spoken of my selfe; but the Father which sent me, he gaue me a
b.JOH.1.25	And they asked him, and said vnto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be
b.JOH.12.5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and giuen to the poore?
b.JOH.12.50	And I know that his commandement is life euerlasting: whatsoeuer I speake
b.JOH.1.26	Iohn answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one
b.JOH.12.6	This he said, not that he cared for the poore: but because hee was a thiefe,
b.JOH.1.27	He it is, who comming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet I
b.JOH.12.7	Then said Iesus, Let her alone, against the day of my burying hath she kept
b.JOH.1.28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordane, where Iohn was baptizing.
b.JOH.12.8	For the poore alwayes yee haue with you: but me ye haue not alwayes.
b.JOH.1.29	The next day, Iohn seeth Iesus comming vnto him, and saith, Behold the Lambe
b.JOH.12.9	Much people of the Iewes therefore knew that he was there: and they came, not
b.JOH.1.3	All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was
b.JOH.1.30	This is he of whom I said, After me commeth a man, which is preferred before
b.JOH.1.31	And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
b.JOH.13.1	Now before the feast of the Passeouer, when Iesus knew that his houre was
b.JOH.13.10	Iesus saith to him, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to wash his feet,
b.JOH.13.11	For he knew who should betray him, therefore said he, Ye are not all cleane.
b.JOH.13.12	So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set
b.JOH.13.13	Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well: for so I am.
b.JOH.13.14	If I then your Lord and Master haue washed your feete, yee also ought to wash
b.JOH.13.15	For I haue giuen you an example, that yee should doe, as I haue done to you.
b.JOH.13.16	Uerily, verily I say vnto you, the seruant is not greater then his lord,
b.JOH.13.17	If yee know these things, happy are ye if ye doe them.
b.JOH.13.18	I speake not of you all, I know whom I haue chosen: but that the Scripture
b.JOH.13.19	Now I tell you before it come, that when it is come to passe, yee may beleeue
b.JOH.1.32	And Iohn bare record saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heauen, like a
b.JOH.13.2	And supper being ended (the deuill hauing now put into the heart of Iudas
b.JOH.13.20	Uerily, verily I say vnto you, he that receiueth whomsoeuer I send, receiueth
b.JOH.13.21	When Iesus had thus sayd, hee was troubled in spirit, and testified, and
b.JOH.13.22	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom hee spake.
b.JOH.13.23	Now there was leaning on Iesus bosome one of his disciples, whom Iesus loued.
b.JOH.13.24	Simon Peter therefore beckened to him, that he should aske who it should be
b.JOH.13.25	Hee then lying on Iesus breast, saith vnto him, Lord, who is it?
b.JOH.13.26	Iesus answered, Hee it is to whom I shall giue a soppe, when I haue dipped
b.JOH.13.27	And after the soppe, Satan entred into him, Then said Iesus vnto him, That
b.JOH.13.28	Now no man at the table knew, for what intent he spake this vnto him.
b.JOH.13.29	For some of them thought, because Iudas had the bagge, that Iesus had sayd
b.JOH.1.33	And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
b.JOH.13.3	Iesus knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands, and that he
b.JOH.13.30	He then hauing receiued the sop, went immediatly out: and it was night.
b.JOH.13.31	Therefore when hee was gone out, Iesus sayd, Now is the Sonne of man
b.JOH.13.32	If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him in himselfe, and
b.JOH.13.33	Litle children, yet a litle while I am with you. Ye shall seeke mee, and as I
b.JOH.13.34	A new commandement I giue vnto you, That yee loue one another, as I haue
b.JOH.13.35	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if yee haue loue one to
b.JOH.13.36	Simon Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Iesus answered him,
b.JOH.13.37	Peter said vnto him, Lord, why can not I follow thee now? I will lay downe my
b.JOH.13.38	Iesus answered him, Wilt thou lay downe thy life for my sake? Uerily, verily
b.JOH.1.34	And I saw, and bare record, that this is the sonne of God.
b.JOH.13.4	He riseth from supper, and layed aside his garments, and tooke a towell, and
b.JOH.1.35	Againe the next day after, Iohn stood, and two of his disciples.
b.JOH.13.5	After that, he powreth water into a bason, and beganne to wash the disciples
b.JOH.1.36	And looking vpon Iesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lambe of God.
b.JOH.13.6	Then commeth he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith vnto him, Lord, doest thou
b.JOH.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speake, and they followed Iesus.
b.JOH.13.7	Iesus answered, and said vnto him, What I doe, thou knowest not now: but thou
b.JOH.1.38	Then Iesus turned, and saw them following, and saith vnto them, What seeke
b.JOH.13.8	Peter saith vnto him, Thou shalt neuer wash my feete. Iesus answered him, If I
b.JOH.1.39	He saith vnto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode
b.JOH.13.9	Simon Peter saith vnto him, Lord, not my feete only, but also my hands, and my
b.JOH.1.4	In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
b.JOH.1.40	One of the two which heard Iohn speake, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon
b.JOH.1.41	He first findeth his owne brother Simon, and saith vnto him, We haue found
b.JOH.14.1	Let not your heart be troubled: yee beleeue in God, beleeue also in me.
b.JOH.14.10	Beleeuest thou not that I am in the father, and the father in mee? The words
b.JOH.14.11	Beleeue me that I am in the Father, and the Father in mee: or else beleeue me
b.JOH.14.12	Uerely, verely I say vnto you, he that beleeueth on me, the works that I doe,
b.JOH.14.13	And whatsoeuer ye shall aske in my Name, that will I doe, that the Father may
b.JOH.14.14	If ye shall aske any thing in my Name, I will doe it.
b.JOH.14.15	If ye loue me, keepe my commandements.
b.JOH.14.16	And I will pray the Father, and hee shall giue you another Comforter, that he
b.JOH.14.17	Euen the Spirit of trueth, whom the world cannot receiue, because it seeth
b.JOH.14.18	I wil not leaue you comfortlesse, I will come to you.
b.JOH.14.19	Yet a litle while, and the world seeth me no more: but ye see me, because I
b.JOH.1.42	And he brought him to Iesus. And when Iesus beheld him, he said, Thou art
b.JOH.14.2	In my Fathers house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would haue told
b.JOH.14.20	At that day ye shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in
b.JOH.14.21	He that hath my commandements, and keepeth them, hee it is that loueth me:
b.JOH.14.22	Iudas saith vnto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest
b.JOH.14.23	Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, If a man loue mee, he will keepe my
b.JOH.14.24	He that loueth mee not, keepeth not my sayings, and the word which you heare,
b.JOH.14.25	These things haue I spoken vnto you, being yet present with you.
b.JOH.14.26	But the Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father wil send in my
b.JOH.14.27	Peace I leaue with you, my peace I giue vnto you, not as the world giueth,
b.JOH.14.28	Ye haue heard how I saide vnto you, I goe away, and come againe vnto you. If
b.JOH.14.29	And now I haue told you before it come to passe, that when it is come to
b.JOH.1.43	The day following, Iesus would goe foorth into
b.JOH.14.3	And if I goe and prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receiue you
b.JOH.14.30	Heereafter I will not talke much with you: for the prince of this world
b.JOH.14.31	But that the world may know that I loue the Father: and as the Father gaue me
b.JOH.1.44	Now Philip was of
b.JOH.14.4	And whither I goe yee know, and the way ye know.
b.JOH.1.45	Philip findeth Nathaneel, and saith vnto him, We haue found him of whom Moses
b.JOH.14.5	Thomas saith vnto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest: and how can we
b.JOH.1.46	And Nathaneel said vnto him, Can there any good thing come out of
b.JOH.14.6	Iesus saith vnto him, I am the Way, the Trueth, and the Life: no man commeth
b.JOH.1.47	Iesus saw Nathaneel comming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite
b.JOH.14.7	If ye had knowen me, ye should haue knowen my Father also: and from henceforth
b.JOH.1.48	Nathaneel sayeth vnto him, Whence knowest thou me? Iesus answered, and said
b.JOH.14.8	Philip sayth vnto him, Lord, shew vs the Father, and it sufficeth vs.
b.JOH.1.49	Nathaneel answered, and saith vnto him, Rabbi, thou art the Sonne of God,
b.JOH.14.9	Iesus saith vnto him, Haue I bin so long time with you, and yet hast thou not
b.JOH.1.5	And the light shineth in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehended it not.
b.JOH.1.50	Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Because I said vnto thee, I saw thee vnder
b.JOH.1.51	And hee saith vnto him, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, heereafter yee shall
b.JOH.15.1	I am the true vine, and my Father is ye husbandman.
b.JOH.15.10	If ye keepe my Commandements, ye shal abide in my loue, euen as I haue kept
b.JOH.15.11	These things haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remaine in you, and
b.JOH.15.12	This is my Commaundement, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you.
b.JOH.15.13	Greater loue hath no man then this, that a man lay downe his life for his
b.JOH.15.14	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoeuer I command you.
b.JOH.15.15	Henceforth I call you not seruants, for the seruant knoweth not what his lord
b.JOH.15.16	Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and ordeined you, that you
b.JOH.15.17	These things I commaund you, that ye loue one another.
b.JOH.15.18	If the world hate you, yee know that it hated me before it hated you.
b.JOH.15.19	If ye were of the world, the world would loue his owne: But because yee are
b.JOH.15.2	Euery branch in me that beareth not fruit, hee taketh away: and euery branch
b.JOH.15.20	Remember the word that I said vnto you, The seruant is not greater then the
b.JOH.15.21	But all these things will they doe vnto you for my Names sake, because they
b.JOH.15.22	If I had not come, and spoken vnto them, they had not had sinne: but now they
b.JOH.15.23	He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
b.JOH.15.24	If I had not done among the the works which none other man did, they had not
b.JOH.15.25	But this commeth to passe, that the word might be fulfilled that is written
b.JOH.15.26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I wil send vnto you from the Father,
b.JOH.15.27	And ye also shall beare witnesse, because ye haue bene with me from the
b.JOH.15.3	Now ye are cleane through the word which I haue spoken vnto you.
b.JOH.15.4	Abide in me, and in you: As the branch cannot beare fruit of itselfe, except
b.JOH.15.5	I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the
b.JOH.15.6	If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered, and
b.JOH.15.7	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall aske what ye will, and
b.JOH.15.8	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruit, so shall ye bee my
b.JOH.15.9	As the Father hath loued me, so haue I loued you: continue ye in my loue.
b.JOH.1.6	There was a man sent from God, whose name was Iohn.
b.JOH.16.1	These things haue I spoken vnto you, that yee should not be offended.
b.JOH.16.10	Of righteousnesse, because I goe to my Father, and ye see me no more.
b.JOH.16.11	Of iudgement, because the prince of this world is iudged.
b.JOH.16.12	I haue yet many things to say vnto you, but ye cannot beare them now:
b.JOH.16.13	Howbeit, when hee the spirit of trueth is come, he wil guide you into all
b.JOH.16.14	He shall glorifie me, for he shall receiue of mine, and shall shew it vnto
b.JOH.16.15	All things that the Father hath, are mine: therefore said I that he shall
b.JOH.16.16	A litle while, and ye shall not see me: and againe a litle while, &amp; ye
b.JOH.16.17	Then saide some of his disciples among themselues, What is this that he saith
b.JOH.16.18	They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A litle while? we cannot
b.JOH.16.19	Now Iesus knew that they were desirous to aske him, &amp; said vnto them, Doe
b.JOH.16.2	They shall put you out of the Synagogues: yea, the time commeth, that
b.JOH.16.20	Uerily, verily I say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, but the world
b.JOH.16.21	A woman, when she is in trauaile, hath sorrow, because her houre is come: but
b.JOH.16.22	And ye now therefore haue sorrow: but I will see you againe, and your heart
b.JOH.16.23	And in that day ye shall aske me nothing: Uerily, verily I say vnto you,
b.JOH.16.24	Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my Name: aske, and ye shall receiue, that
b.JOH.16.25	These things haue I spoken vnto you in prouerbs: the time commeth when I
b.JOH.16.26	At that day ye shall aske in my Name: and I say not vnto you that I will pray
b.JOH.16.27	For the Father himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me and haue
b.JOH.16.28	I came foorth from the Father, and am come into the world: againe, I leaue
b.JOH.16.29	His disciples said vnto him, Loe, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no
b.JOH.16.3	And these things will they doe vnto you, because they haue not knowen the
b.JOH.16.30	Now are we sure that thou knowest al things, and needest not that any man
b.JOH.16.31	Iesus answered them, Doe yee now beleeue?
b.JOH.16.32	Behold, the houre commeth, yea is now come, that ye shall be scattered, euery
b.JOH.16.33	These things I haue spoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace, in the
b.JOH.16.4	But these things haue I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may
b.JOH.16.5	But now I goe my way to him that sent mee, and none of you asketh me, Whither
b.JOH.16.6	But because I haue saide these things vnto you, sorow hath filled your heart.
b.JOH.16.7	Neuerthelesse; I tell you the trueth, it is expedient for you that I goe away:
b.JOH.16.8	And when he is come, he will reproue the world of sinne, and of righteousnesse,
b.JOH.16.9	Of sinne, because they beleeue not on me.
b.JOH.1.7	The same came for a witnesse, to beare witnesse of the light, that all men
b.JOH.17.1	These words spake Iesus, and lift vp his eyes to heauen, and said, Father, the
b.JOH.17.10	And all mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.
b.JOH.17.11	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to
b.JOH.17.12	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name: those that thou
b.JOH.17.13	And now come I to thee, and these things I speake in the world, that they
b.JOH.17.14	I haue giuen them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are
b.JOH.17.15	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou
b.JOH.17.16	They are not of the world, euen as I am not of the world.
b.JOH.17.17	Sanctifie them through thy trueth: thy word is trueth.
b.JOH.17.18	As thou hast sent mee into the world: euen so haue I also sent them into the
b.JOH.17.19	And for their sakes I sanctifie my selfe, that they also might be sanctified
b.JOH.17.2	As thou hast giuen him power ouer all flesh, that he should giue eternall life
b.JOH.17.20	Neither pray I for these alone; but for them also which shall beleeue on me
b.JOH.17.21	That they all may be one, as thou Father art in mee, and I in thee, that they
b.JOH.17.22	And the glory which thou gauest me, I haue giuen them: that they may be one,
b.JOH.17.23	I in them, and thou in mee, that they may bee made perfect in one, and that
b.JOH.17.24	Father, I will that they also whom thou hast giuen me, be with me where I am,
b.JOH.17.25	O righteous Father, the world hath not knowen thee, but I haue knowen thee,
b.JOH.17.26	And I haue declared vnto them thy Name, and will declare it: that the loue
b.JOH.17.3	And this is life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God, and
b.JOH.17.4	I haue glorified thee on the earth: I haue finished the worke which thou
b.JOH.17.5	And now O Father, glorifie thou me, with thine owne selfe, with the glory
b.JOH.17.6	I haue manifested thy Name vnto the men which thou gauest me out of the world:
b.JOH.17.7	Now they haue knowen that all things whatsoeuer thou hast giuen me, are of
b.JOH.17.8	For I haue giuen vnto them the words which thou gauest me, and they haue
b.JOH.17.9	I pray for them, I pray not for the world: but for them which thou hast giuen
b.JOH.1.8	Hee was not that light, but was sent to beare witnesse of that light.
b.JOH.18.1	When Iesus had spoken these wordes, hee went foorth with his disciples ouer
b.JOH.18.10	Then Simon Peter hauing a sword, drewe it, and smote the high Priests seruant,
b.JOH.18.11	Then said Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sword into the sheath: the cup which
b.JOH.18.12	Then the band and the captaine, and officers of the Iewes, tooke Iesus, and
b.JOH.18.13	And led him away to Annas first, (for he was father in law to Caiaphas) which
b.JOH.18.14	Now Caiaphas was he which gaue counsell to the Iewes, that it was expedient
b.JOH.18.15	And Simon Peter followed Iesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple
b.JOH.18.16	But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out that other disciple,
b.JOH.18.17	Then saith the damosell that kept the doore vnto Peter, Art not thou also one
b.JOH.18.18	And the seruants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coales,
b.JOH.18.19	The high Priest then asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
b.JOH.18.2	And Iudas also which betrayed him, knew the place: for Iesus oft times
b.JOH.18.20	Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world, I euer taught in the
b.JOH.18.21	Why askest thou me? Aske them which heard me, what I haue said vnto them:
b.JOH.18.22	And when hee had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by, stroke
b.JOH.18.23	Iesus answered him, If I haue spoken euill, beare witnesse of the euill: but
b.JOH.18.24	Now Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the high Priest.
b.JOH.18.25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himselfe: They said therefore vnto him, Art
b.JOH.18.26	One of the seruants of the high Priests (being his kinsman whose eare Peter
b.JOH.18.27	Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crew.
b.JOH.18.28	Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas vnto the hall of Iudgement: And it was
b.JOH.18.29	Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring you against
b.JOH.18.3	Iudas then hauing receiued a band of men, and officers from the chiefe Priests
b.JOH.18.30	They answered, &amp; said vnto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not
b.JOH.18.31	Then saide Pilate vnto them, Take ye him, and iudge him according to your
b.JOH.18.32	That the saying of Iesus might be fulfilled, which hee spake, signifying what
b.JOH.18.33	Then Pilate entred into the Iudgement hall againe, and called Iesus, and
b.JOH.18.34	Iesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thy selfe? or did others tell
b.JOH.18.35	Pilate answered, Am I a Iew? Thine owne nation, and the chiefe Priests haue
b.JOH.18.36	Iesus answered, My kingdome is not of this world: if my kingdome were of this
b.JOH.18.37	Pilate therefore saide vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou
b.JOH.18.38	Pilate saith vnto him, What is trueth? And when hee had said this, he went
b.JOH.18.39	But yee haue a custome that I should release vnto you one at the Passeouer:
b.JOH.18.4	Iesus therefore knowing all things that should come vpon him, went foorth, and
b.JOH.18.40	Then cried they all againe, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas
b.JOH.18.5	They answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus saith vnto them, I am hee. And
b.JOH.18.6	Assoone then as he had said vnto them, I am he, they went backeward, and fell
b.JOH.18.7	Then asked hee them againe, Whom seeke ye? And they said, Iesus of Nazareth.
b.JOH.18.8	Iesus answered, I haue tolde you that I am he: If therefore ye seeke me, let
b.JOH.18.9	That the saying might be fulfilled which he spake, Of them which thou gauest
b.JOH.1.9	That was the true light, which lighteth euery man that commeth into the world.
b.JOH.19.1	Then Pilate therfore tooke Iesus, and scourged him.
b.JOH.19.10	Then saith Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not, that
b.JOH.19.11	Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were
b.JOH.19.12	And from thencefore Pilate sought to release him: but the Iewes cried out,
b.JOH.19.13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Iesus foorth, and sate
b.JOH.19.14	And it was the preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and he
b.JOH.19.15	But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate saith
b.JOH.19.16	Then deliuered he him therfore vnto them to be crucified: and they took Iesus,
b.JOH.19.17	And he bearing his crosse, went foorth into a place called the place of a
b.JOH.19.18	Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and
b.JOH.19.19	And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the crosse. And the writing was,
b.JOH.19.2	And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and
b.JOH.19.20	This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was
b.JOH.19.21	Then said the chiefe Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The king of
b.JOH.19.22	Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.
b.JOH.19.23	Then the souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments, (and
b.JOH.19.24	They said therefore among themselues, Let not vs rent it, but cast lots for
b.JOH.19.25	Now there stood by the crosse of Iesus, his mother, and his mothers sister,
b.JOH.19.26	When Iesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he
b.JOH.19.27	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that houre that
b.JOH.19.28	After this, Iesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the
b.JOH.19.29	Now there was set a vessell, full of vineger: And they filled a spunge with
b.JOH.19.3	And said, Haile king of the Iewes: and they smote him with their hands.
b.JOH.19.30	When Iesus therefore had receiued the vineger, he said, It is finished, and
b.JOH.19.31	The Iewes therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should
b.JOH.19.32	Then came the souldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other,
b.JOH.19.33	But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not
b.JOH.19.34	But one of the souldiers with a speare pierced his side, and forthwith came
b.JOH.19.35	And he that saw it, bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that
b.JOH.19.36	For these things were done, that the Scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of
b.JOH.19.37	And againe another Scripture saith, They shall looke on him whom they piersed.
b.JOH.19.38	And after this, Ioseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Iesus, but secretly
b.JOH.19.39	And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Iesus by night, and
b.JOH.19.4	Pilate therefore went foorth againe, and saith vnto them, Behold, I bring him
b.JOH.19.40	Then tooke they the body of Iesus, &amp; wound it in linnen clothes, with the
b.JOH.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the
b.JOH.19.42	There laid they Iesus therefore, because of the Iewes preparation day, for
b.JOH.19.5	Then came Iesus forth, wearing the crowne of thornes, and the purple robe: and
b.JOH.19.6	When the chiefe Priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out,
b.JOH.19.7	The Iewes answered him, We haue a law, and by our law he ought to die, because
b.JOH.19.8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid,
b.JOH.19.9	And went againe into the iudgement hall, &amp; saith vnto Iesus, Whence art
b.JOH.20.1	The first day of the weeke, commeth Mary Magdalene earely when it was yet
b.JOH.20.10	Then the disciples went away againe vnto their owne home.
b.JOH.20.11	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping: &amp; as shee wept, she
b.JOH.20.12	And seeth two Angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at
b.JOH.20.13	And they say vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Shee saith vnto them, Because
b.JOH.20.14	And when she had thus said, she turned herselfe backe, and saw Iesus
b.JOH.20.15	Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She
b.JOH.20.16	Iesus saith vnto her, Mary. She turned herselfe, and saith vnto him, Rabboni,
b.JOH.20.17	Iesus saith vnto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father:
b.JOH.20.18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that shee had seene the Lord, and
b.JOH.20.19	Then the same day at euening, being the first day of the weeke, when the
b.JOH.20.2	Then she runneth and commeth to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom
b.JOH.20.20	And when hee had so saide, hee shewed vnto them his hands and his side. Then
b.JOH.20.21	Then said Iesus to them againe, Peace be vnto you: As my Father hath sent me,
b.JOH.20.22	And when he had said this, hee breathed on them, and saith vnto them, Receiue
b.JOH.20.23	Whose soeuer sinnes yee remit, they are remitted vnto them, and whose soeuer
b.JOH.20.24	But Thomas one of the twelue, called Didymus, was not with them when Iesus
b.JOH.20.25	The other disciples therefore said vnto him, We haue seene the Lord. But he
b.JOH.20.26	And after eight dayes, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with
b.JOH.20.27	Then saith he to Thomas Reach hither thy finger, and beholde my hands, and
b.JOH.20.28	And Thomas answered, and said vnto him, My Lord, and my God.
b.JOH.20.29	Iesus saith vnto him, Thomas, because thou hast seene mee, thou hast beleeued:
b.JOH.20.3	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the Sepulchre.
b.JOH.20.30	And many other signes truely did Iesus in the presence of his disciples,
b.JOH.20.31	But these are written, that yee might beleeue that Iesus is the Christ the
b.JOH.20.4	So they ranne both together, and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came
b.JOH.20.5	And he stouping downe and looking in, saw the linnen clothes lying, yet went
b.JOH.20.6	Then commeth Simon Peter following him, and went into the Sepulchre, and seeth
b.JOH.20.7	And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linnen clothes, but
b.JOH.20.8	Then went in also that other disciple which came first to the Sepulchre, and
b.JOH.20.9	For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that hee must rise againe from the
b.JOH.2.1	And the third day there was a mariage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of
b.JOH.2.10	And saith vnto him, Euery man at the beginning doth set foorth good wine, and
b.JOH.2.11	This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth
b.JOH.21.1	After these things Iesus shewed himselfe againe to the disciples at the
b.JOH.21.10	Iesus saith vnto them, Bring of the fish, which ye haue now caught.
b.JOH.21.11	Simon Peter went vp, &amp; drewe the net to land full of great fishes, an
b.JOH.21.12	Iesus saith vnto them, Come, and dine. And none of the disciples durst aske
b.JOH.21.13	Iesus then commeth, and taketh bread, and giueth them, and fish likewise.
b.JOH.21.14	This is nowe the third time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his disciples,
b.JOH.21.15	So when they had dined, Iesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, sonne of Ionas,
b.JOH.21.16	He saith to him againe the second time, Simon sonne of Ionas, louest thou me?
b.JOH.21.17	He said vnto him the third time, Simon sonne of Ionas, louest thou mee? Peter
b.JOH.21.18	Uerily, verily I say vnto thee, whe thou wast yong, thou girdedst thy selfe,
b.JOH.21.19	This spake hee, signifying by what death he should glorifie God. And when he
b.JOH.2.12	After this hee went downe to
b.JOH.21.2	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathaneel of
b.JOH.21.20	Then Peter turning about, seeth the Disciple whom Iesus loued, following,
b.JOH.21.21	Peter seeing him, saith to Iesus, Lord, and what shall this man doe?
b.JOH.21.22	Iesus saith vnto him, If I will that he tary till I come, what is that to
b.JOH.21.23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that Disciple should
b.JOH.21.24	This is the Disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these
b.JOH.21.25	And there are also many other things which Iesus did, the which if they
b.JOH.2.13	And the Iewes Passeouer was at hand, &amp; Iesus went vp to Hierusalem
b.JOH.21.3	Simon Peter saith vnto them, I goe a fishing. They say vnto him, Wee also goe
b.JOH.2.14	And found in the
b.JOH.21.4	But when the morning was now come, Iesus stood on the shore: but the disciples
b.JOH.2.15	And when he had made a scourge of small cordes, he droue them all out of the
b.JOH.21.5	Then Iesus saith vnto them, Children, haue ye any meat? They answered him, No.
b.JOH.2.16	And said vnto them that sold doues Take these things hence, make not my
b.JOH.21.6	And he said vnto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and yee
b.JOH.2.17	And his disciples remembred that it was written, The zeale of thine house
b.JOH.21.7	Therefore that Disciple whome Iesus loued, saith vnto Peter, It is the Lord.
b.JOH.2.18	Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, What signe shewest thou vnto vs,
b.JOH.21.8	And the other disciples came in a litle ship (for they were not farre from
b.JOH.2.19	Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Destroy this temple, and in three dayes I
b.JOH.21.9	Assoone then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coales there, and
b.JOH.2.2	And both Iesus was called, and his disciples, to the mariage.
b.JOH.2.20	Then said the Iewes, Fourty and six yeres was this
b.JOH.2.21	But he spake of the temple of his body.
b.JOH.2.22	When therefore hee was risen from the dead, his disciples remembred that hee
b.JOH.2.23	Now when hee was in Hierusalem at the Passeouer, in the feast day, many
b.JOH.2.24	But Iesus did not commit himselfe vnto them, because he knew al men,
b.JOH.2.25	And needed not that any should testifie of man: for hee knew what was in man.
b.JOH.2.3	And when they wanted wine, the mother of Iesus saith vnto him, They haue no
b.JOH.2.4	Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, what haue I to doe with thee? mine houre is not
b.JOH.2.5	His mother saith vnto ye seruants, Whatsoeuer he saith vnto you, doe it.
b.JOH.2.6	And there were set there sixe water pots of stone, after the maner of the
b.JOH.2.7	Iesus saith vnto them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them vp
b.JOH.2.8	And hee saith vnto them, Drawe out now, and beare vnto the gouernor of the
b.JOH.2.9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew
b.JOH.3.1	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of ye Iewes:
b.JOH.3.10	Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, Art thou a master of
b.JOH.3.11	Uerely, verely I say vnto thee, We speake that we doe know, and testifie that
b.JOH.3.12	If I haue tolde you earthly things, and ye beleeue not: how shall ye beleeue
b.JOH.3.13	And no man hath ascended vp to heauen, but hee that came downe from heauen,
b.JOH.3.14	And as Moses lifted vp the serpent in the wildernesse: euen so must the Sonne
b.JOH.3.15	That whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue eternall life.
b.JOH.3.16	For God so loued ye world, that he gaue his only begotten Sonne: that
b.JOH.3.17	For God sent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the
b.JOH.3.18	He that beleeueth on him, is not condemned: but hee that beleeueth not, is
b.JOH.3.19	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
b.JOH.3.2	The same came to Iesus by night, and said vnto him, Rabbi, wee know that thou
b.JOH.3.20	For euery one that doeth euill, hateth the light, neither commeth to the
b.JOH.3.21	But hee that doeth trueth, commeth to the light, that his deeds may be made
b.JOH.3.22	After these things, came Iesus and his disciples into the
b.JOH.3.23	And Iohn also was baptizing in Aenon, neere to Salim, because there was much
b.JOH.3.24	For Iohn was not yet cast into prison.
b.JOH.3.25	Then there arose a question between some of Iohns disciples and the Iewes,
b.JOH.3.26	And they came vnto Iohn, and said vnto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee
b.JOH.3.27	Iohn answered, and said, A man can receiue nothing, except it be giuen him
b.JOH.3.28	Ye your selues beare me witnesse, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that
b.JOH.3.29	He that hath the bride, is the bridegrome: but the friend of the bridegrome,
b.JOH.3.3	Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Uerily, verily I say vnto thee, except a
b.JOH.3.30	Hee must increase, but I must decrease.
b.JOH.3.31	Hee that commeth from aboue, is aboue all: hee that is of the earth, is
b.JOH.3.32	And what hee hath seene and heard, that he testifieth, and no man receiueth
b.JOH.3.33	He that hath receiued his testimonie, hath set to his seale, that God is
b.JOH.3.34	For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: For God giueth not the
b.JOH.3.35	The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath giuen al things into his hand.
b.JOH.3.36	He that beleeueth on the Sonne, hath euerlasting life: and he that beleeueth
b.JOH.3.4	Nicodemus saith vnto him, How can a man be borne when he is old? Can he enter
b.JOH.3.5	Iesus answered, Uerily, verily I say vnto thee, except a man be borne of water
b.JOH.3.6	That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh, and that which is borne of the
b.JOH.3.7	Marueile not that I saide vnto thee, Ye must be borne againe.
b.JOH.3.8	The winde bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but
b.JOH.3.9	Nicodemus answered, and said vnto him, How can these things be?
b.JOH.4.1	When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Iesus made and
b.JOH.4.10	Iesus answered, and said vnto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who
b.JOH.4.11	The woman saith vnto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to drawe with, and the Well
b.JOH.4.12	Art thou greater then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the Well, and dranke
b.JOH.4.13	Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Whosoeuer drinketh of this water, shall
b.JOH.4.14	But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shal giue him, shall neuer thirst:
b.JOH.4.15	The woman saith vnto him, Sir, giue me this water, that I thirst not, neither
b.JOH.4.16	Iesus saith vnto her, Goe, call thy husband, and come hither.
b.JOH.4.17	The woman answered, and said, I haue no husband. Iesus said vnto her, Thou
b.JOH.4.18	For thou hast had fiue husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy
b.JOH.4.19	The woman saith vnto him, Sir, I perceiue that thou art a Prophet.
b.JOH.4.2	(Though Iesus himselfe baptized not, but his disciples:)
b.JOH.4.20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine, and ye say, that in Hierusalem is
b.JOH.4.21	Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, beleeue me, the houre commeth when ye shall
b.JOH.4.22	Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for saluation is of the
b.JOH.4.23	But the houre commeth, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
b.JOH.4.24	God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit, and
b.JOH.4.25	The woman saith vnto him, I know that Messias commeth, which is called
b.JOH.4.26	Iesus sayth vnto her, I that speake vnto thee, am hee.
b.JOH.4.27	And vpon this came his disciples, and marueiled that he talked with the
b.JOH.4.28	The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and sayth
b.JOH.4.29	Come, see a man, which tolde me all things that euer I did: Is not this the
b.JOH.4.3	He left Iudea, and departed againe into Galile.
b.JOH.4.30	Then they went out of the citie, and came vnto him.
b.JOH.4.31	In the meane while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eate.
b.JOH.4.32	But hee said vnto them, I haue meate to eate that ye know not of.
b.JOH.4.33	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought
b.JOH.4.34	Iesus saith vnto them, My meat is, to doe the will of him that sent mee, and
b.JOH.4.35	Say not ye, There are yet foure moneths, and then commeth haruest? Behold, I
b.JOH.4.36	And hee that reapeth receiueth wages, and gathereth fruite vnto life eternall:
b.JOH.4.37	And herein is that saying true: One soweth, and another reapeth.
b.JOH.4.38	I sent you to reape that, whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured,
b.JOH.4.39	And many of the Samaritanes of that citie beleeued on him, for the saying of
b.JOH.4.4	And hee must needs goe thorow
b.JOH.4.40	So when the Samaritanes were come vnto him, they besought him that he would
b.JOH.4.41	And many moe beleeued, because of his owne word:
b.JOH.4.42	And said vnto the woman, Now we beleeue, not because of thy saying, for we
b.JOH.4.43	Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into
b.JOH.4.44	For Iesus himselfe testified, that a Prophet hath no honour in his owne
b.JOH.4.45	Then when hee was come into
b.JOH.4.46	So Iesus came againe into Cana of Galilee, where hee made the water wine. And
b.JOH.4.47	When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galilee, hee went vnto
b.JOH.4.48	Then said Iesus vnto him, Except ye see signes and wonders, yee will not
b.JOH.4.49	The noble man saith vnto him, Syr, come downe ere my child die.
b.JOH.4.5	Then commeth he to a city of
b.JOH.4.50	Iesus saith vnto him, Go thy way, thy sonne liueth. And the man beleeued the
b.JOH.4.51	And as he was now going down, his seruants met him, and told him, saying, Thy
b.JOH.4.52	Then inquired hee of them the houre when he began to amend: and they said
b.JOH.4.53	So the father knewe that it was at the same houre, in the which Iesus said
b.JOH.4.54	This is againe the second miracle that Iesus did, when hee was come out of
b.JOH.4.6	Now Iacobs Well was there. Iesus therefore being wearied with his iourney,
b.JOH.4.7	There commeth a woman of
b.JOH.4.8	For his disciples were gone away vnto the city to buy meate.
b.JOH.4.9	Then saith the woman of
b.JOH.5.1	After this there was a feast of the Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.
b.JOH.5.10	The Iewes therefore said vnto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath day, it
b.JOH.5.11	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said vnto me, Take vp thy
b.JOH.5.12	Then asked they him, What man is that which said vnto thee, Take vp thy bed,
b.JOH.5.13	And he that was healed, wist not who it was: for Iesus had conueyed himselfe
b.JOH.5.14	Afterward Iesus findeth him in the
b.JOH.5.15	The man departed, and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus which had made him
b.JOH.5.16	And therefore did the Iewes persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him, because
b.JOH.5.17	But Iesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, &amp; I worke.
b.JOH.5.18	Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him, not onely because hee had
b.JOH.5.19	Then answered Iesus, and saide vnto them, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, The
b.JOH.5.2	Now there is at Hierusalem by the sheepe market, a poole, which is called in
b.JOH.5.20	For the father loueth the sonne, and sheweth him all things that himselfe
b.JOH.5.21	For as the Father raiseth vp the dead, and quickeneth them: euen so the Sonne
b.JOH.5.22	For the Father iudgeth no man: but hath committed all iudgement vnto the
b.JOH.5.23	That all men should honour the Son, euen as they honour the Father. He that
b.JOH.5.24	Uerily, verily I say vnto you, Hee that heareth my word, &amp; beleeueth on
b.JOH.5.25	Uerily, verily I say vnto you, The houre is comming, &amp; now is, when the
b.JOH.5.26	For as the Father hath life in himselfe: so hath he giuen to the Sonne to
b.JOH.5.27	And hath giuen him authority to execute iudgement also, because he is the
b.JOH.5.28	Marueile not at this: for the houre is comming, in the which all that are in
b.JOH.5.29	And shall come foorth, they that haue done good, vnto the resurrection of
b.JOH.5.3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folke, of blind, halt, withered,
b.JOH.5.30	I can of mine owne selfe doe nothing: as I heare, I iudge: and my iudgement
b.JOH.5.31	If I beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse is not true.
b.JOH.5.32	There is another that beareth witnesse of me, &amp; I know that the witnesse
b.JOH.5.33	Ye sent vnto Iohn, and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth.
b.JOH.5.34	But I receiue not testimonie from man: but these things I say, that ye might
b.JOH.5.35	He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to
b.JOH.5.36	But I haue greater witnesse then that of Iohn: for the workes which the
b.JOH.5.37	And the Father himselfe which hath sent me, hath borne witnesse of me. Ye
b.JOH.5.38	And ye haue not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye
b.JOH.5.39	Search the Scriptures, for in them ye thinke ye haue eternall life, and they
b.JOH.5.4	For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole, and troubled the
b.JOH.5.40	And ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life.
b.JOH.5.41	I receiue not honour from men.
b.JOH.5.42	But I know you, that ye haue not the loue of God in you.
b.JOH.5.43	I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in
b.JOH.5.44	How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, &amp; seeke not the
b.JOH.5.45	Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that
b.JOH.5.46	For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for he wrote of me.
b.JOH.5.47	But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shall ye beleeue my words?
b.JOH.5.5	And a certaine man was there, which had an infirmitie thirtie and eight yeeres.
b.JOH.5.6	When Iesus saw him lie, &amp; knew that hee had beene now a long time in that
b.JOH.5.7	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I haue no man when the water is troubled,
b.JOH.5.8	Iesus sayth vnto him, Rise, take vp thy bed, and walke.
b.JOH.5.9	And immediatly the man was made whole, and tooke vp his bed, and walked: And
b.JOH.6.1	After these things Iesus went ouer the sea of Galilee, which is the
b.JOH.6.10	And Iesus said, Make the men sit downe. Now there was much
b.JOH.6.11	And Iesus tooke the loaues, and when he had giuen thankes, hee distributed to
b.JOH.6.12	When they were filled, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the fragments
b.JOH.6.13	Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelue baskets with the
b.JOH.6.14	Then those men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, said, This is
b.JOH.6.15	When Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take him by force, to
b.JOH.6.16	And when euen was now come, his disciples went downe vnto the sea,
b.JOH.6.17	And entred into a ship, and went ouer the sea towards
b.JOH.6.18	And the sea arose, by reason of a great winde that blew.
b.JOH.6.19	So when they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they see
b.JOH.6.2	And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which hee
b.JOH.6.20	But he saith vnto them, It is I, be not afraid.
b.JOH.6.21	Then they willingly receiued him into the ship, and immediatly the ship was
b.JOH.6.22	The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea,
b.JOH.6.23	Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias, nigh vnto the place where they
b.JOH.6.24	When the people therefore saw that Iesus was not there, neither his
b.JOH.6.25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they saide vnto
b.JOH.6.26	Iesus answered them, and said, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Ye seeke me,
b.JOH.6.27	Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth
b.JOH.6.28	Then said they vnto him, What shall we doe, that we might worke the workes of
b.JOH.6.29	Iesus answered, and said vnto them, This is the worke of God, that ye beleeue
b.JOH.6.3	And Iesus went vp into a mountaine, and there hee sate with his disciples.
b.JOH.6.30	They said therefore vnto him, What signe shewest thou then, that we may see,
b.JOH.6.31	Our fathers did eate Manna in the desert, as it is written, He gaue them
b.JOH.6.32	Then Iesus said vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Moses gaue you not
b.JOH.6.33	For the bread of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life
b.JOH.6.34	Then said they vnto him, Lord, euermore giue vs this bread.
b.JOH.6.35	And Iesus said vnto them, I am the bread of life: hee that commeth to me,
b.JOH.6.36	But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.
b.JOH.6.37	All that the Father giueth mee, shall come to mee; and him that commeth to
b.JOH.6.38	For I came downe from heauen, not to doe mine owne will, but the will of him
b.JOH.6.39	And this is the Fathers wil which hath sent me, that of all which he hath
b.JOH.6.4	And the Passeouer, a feast of the Iewes, was nigh.
b.JOH.6.40	And this is the will of him that sent me, that euery one which seeth the
b.JOH.6.41	The Iewes then murmured at him, because hee said, I am the bread which came
b.JOH.6.42	And they said, Is not this Iesus the sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother
b.JOH.6.43	Iesus therefore answered, and said vnto them, Murmure not among your selues.
b.JOH.6.44	No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him: and I
b.JOH.6.45	It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Euery man
b.JOH.6.46	Not that any man hath seene the Father; saue hee which is of God, hee hath
b.JOH.6.47	Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Hee that beleeueth on me, hath euerlasting
b.JOH.6.48	I am that bread of life.
b.JOH.6.49	Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead.
b.JOH.6.5	When Iesus then lift vp his eyes, and saw a great company come vnto him, he
b.JOH.6.50	This is the bread which commeth downe from heauen, that a man may eate
b.JOH.6.51	I am the liuing bread, which came downe from heauen. If any man eate of this
b.JOH.6.52	The Iewes therefore stroue amongst themselues, saying, How can this man giue
b.JOH.6.53	Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Except yee eate the
b.JOH.6.54	Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will
b.JOH.6.55	For my flesh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed.
b.JOH.6.56	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
b.JOH.6.57	As the liuing Father hath sent me, and I liue by the Father: so, he that
b.JOH.6.58	This is that bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers did eate
b.JOH.6.59	These things said hee in the Synagogue, as he taught in
b.JOH.6.6	(And this he said to proue him: for he himselfe knew what he would doe)
b.JOH.6.60	Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an
b.JOH.6.61	When Iesus knew in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at it, hee said vnto
b.JOH.6.62	What and if yee shall see the sonne of man ascend vp where hee was before?
b.JOH.6.63	It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: the wordes
b.JOH.6.64	But there are some of you that beleeue not. For Iesus knew from the
b.JOH.6.65	And he said, Therefore said I vnto you, that no man can come vnto me, except
b.JOH.6.66	From that time many of his disciples went backe, and walked no more with him.
b.JOH.6.67	Then said Iesus vnto the twelue, Will ye also goe away?
b.JOH.6.68	Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we goe? Thou hast the
b.JOH.6.69	And we beleeue and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the
b.JOH.6.7	Philip answered him, Two hundred peny-worth of bread is not sufficient for
b.JOH.6.70	Iesus answered them, Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a deuill?
b.JOH.6.71	He spake of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: for hee it was that should
b.JOH.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, saith vnto him,
b.JOH.6.9	There is a lad here, which hath fiue barley loaues, and two small fishes: but
b.JOH.7.1	After these things, Iesus walked in
b.JOH.7.10	But when his brethren were gone vp, then went he also vp vnto the feast, not
b.JOH.7.11	Then the Iewes sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
b.JOH.7.12	And there was much murmuring among the people, concerning him: For some said,
b.JOH.7.13	Howbeit, no man spake openly of him, for feare of the Iewes.
b.JOH.7.14	Now about the middest of the feast, Iesus went vp into the
b.JOH.7.15	And the Iewes marueiled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, hauing neuer
b.JOH.7.16	Iesus answered them, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
b.JOH.7.17	If any man will doe his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
b.JOH.7.18	He that speaketh of himselfe, seeketh his owne glory: but he that seeketh his
b.JOH.7.19	Did not Moses giue you the Law, and yet none of you keepeth the Law? Why goe
b.JOH.7.2	Now the Iewes feast of Tabernacles was at hand.
b.JOH.7.20	The people answered, and sayd, Thou hast a deuill: Who goeth about to kill
b.JOH.7.21	Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, I haue done one worke, and yee all
b.JOH.7.22	Moses therefore gaue vnto you Circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but
b.JOH.7.23	If a man on the Sabbath day receiue circumcision, that the Lawe of Moses
b.JOH.7.24	Iudge not according to the appearance, but iudge righteous iudgement.
b.JOH.7.25	Then said some of them of Hierusalem, Is not this hee, whome they seeke to
b.JOH.7.26	But loe, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing vnto him: Doe the rulers
b.JOH.7.27	Howbeit wee know this man whence he is: but when Christ commeth, no man
b.JOH.7.28	Then cried Iesus in the Temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye
b.JOH.7.29	But I know him, for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
b.JOH.7.3	His brethren therefore saide vnto him, Depart hence, and go into Iudea, that
b.JOH.7.30	Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his houre
b.JOH.7.31	And many of the people beleeued on him, &amp; said, When Christ commeth, will
b.JOH.7.32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: And
b.JOH.7.33	Then said Iesus vnto them, Yet a litle while am I with you, and then I goe
b.JOH.7.34	Ye shall seeke me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither yee cannot
b.JOH.7.35	Then saide the Iewes among themselues, Whither will hee goe, that we shall
b.JOH.7.36	What maner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seeke me, and shall not
b.JOH.7.37	In the last day, that great day of the feast, Iesus stood, and cried, saying,
b.JOH.7.38	He that beleeueth on me, as the Scripture hath saide, out of his belly shall
b.JOH.7.39	(But this spake he of the Spirit which they that beleeue on him, should
b.JOH.7.4	For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and hee himselfe seeketh to
b.JOH.7.40	Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, saide, Of a trueth
b.JOH.7.41	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of
b.JOH.7.42	Hath not the Scripture saide, that Christ commeth of the seede of Dauid, and
b.JOH.7.43	So there was diuision among the people because of him.
b.JOH.7.44	And some of them would haue taken him, but no man layed hands on him.
b.JOH.7.45	Then came the officers to the chiefe Priests and Pharises, and they said vnto
b.JOH.7.46	The officers answered, Neuer man spake like this man.
b.JOH.7.47	Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceiued?
b.JOH.7.48	Haue any of the rulers, or of the Pharises beleeued on him?
b.JOH.7.49	But this people who knoweth not the Law, are cursed.
b.JOH.7.5	For neither did his brethren beleeue in him.
b.JOH.7.50	Nicodemus saith vnto them, (He that came to Iesus by night, being one of
b.JOH.7.51	Doth our Law iudge any man before it heare him, &amp; know what he doth?
b.JOH.7.52	They answered, and said vnto him, Art thou also of
b.JOH.7.53	And euery man went vnto his owne house.
b.JOH.7.6	Then Iesus said vnto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway
b.JOH.7.7	The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that
b.JOH.7.8	Goe ye vp vnto this feast: I goe not vp yet vnto this feast, for my time is
b.JOH.7.9	When he had said these words vnto them, he abode still in
b.JOH.8.1	Iesus went vnto ye Mount of Oliues:
b.JOH.8.10	When Iesus had lift vp himselfe, and saw none but the woman, hee said vnto
b.JOH.8.11	She saide, No man, Lord. And Iesus saide vnto her, Neither doe I condemne
b.JOH.8.12	Then spake Iesus againe vnto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he
b.JOH.8.13	The Pharisees therefore said vnto him, Thou bearest record of thy selfe, thy
b.JOH.8.14	Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Though I beare record of my selfe, yet my
b.JOH.8.15	Yee iudge after the flesh, I iudge no man.
b.JOH.8.16	And yet if I iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I and the
b.JOH.8.17	It is also written in your Law, that the testimonie of two men is true.
b.JOH.8.18	I am one that beare witnesse of my selfe, and the Father that sent mee,
b.JOH.8.19	Then said they vnto him, Where is thy Father? Iesus answered, Ye neither know
b.JOH.8.2	And earely in the morning hee came againe into the
b.JOH.8.20	These words spake Iesus in the treasury, as hee taught in the
b.JOH.8.21	Then saide Iesus againe vnto them, I goe my way, and ye shall seeke me, &amp;
b.JOH.8.22	Then said the Iewes, Will hee kill himselfe? because he saith, Whither I goe,
b.JOH.8.23	And hee said vnto them, Yee are from beneath, I am from aboue: Yee are of
b.JOH.8.24	I said therefore vnto you, that ye shall die in your sinnes. For if yee
b.JOH.8.25	Then said they vnto him, Who art thou? And Iesus saith vnto them, Euen the
b.JOH.8.26	I haue many things to say, and to iudge of you: But hee that sent mee is
b.JOH.8.27	They vnderstood not that hee spake to them of the Father.
b.JOH.8.28	Then saide Iesus vnto them, When yee haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then
b.JOH.8.29	And he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left mee alone: for I
b.JOH.8.3	And the Scribes and Pharisees brought vnto him a woman taken in adultery, and
b.JOH.8.30	As hee spake those words, many beleeued on him.
b.JOH.8.31	Then said Iesus to those Iewes which beleeued on him, If ye continue in my
b.JOH.8.32	And ye shall know the Trueth, and the Trueth shall make you free.
b.JOH.8.33	They answered him, We be Abraham seed, and were neuer in bondage to any man:
b.JOH.8.34	Iesus answered them, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, Whosoeuer committeth
b.JOH.8.35	And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: but the Sonne abideth euer.
b.JOH.8.36	If the Sonne therfore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
b.JOH.8.37	I know that yee are Abrahams seed, but ye seeke to kill mee, because my word
b.JOH.8.38	I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye do that which ye haue
b.JOH.8.39	They answered, and said vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus sayth vnto
b.JOH.8.4	They say vnto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
b.JOH.8.40	But now yee seeke to kill me, a man that hath tolde you the trueth, which I
b.JOH.8.41	Ye doe the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not borne of
b.JOH.8.42	Iesus said vnto them, If God were your Father, yee would loue me, for I
b.JOH.8.43	Why doe yee not vnderstand my speech? euen because yee cannot heare my word.
b.JOH.8.44	Ye are of your father the deuill, and the lusts of your father ye will doe:
b.JOH.8.45	And because I tell you the truth, ye beleeue me not.
b.JOH.8.46	Which of you conuinceth mee of sinne? And if I say the trueth, why doe ye not
b.JOH.8.47	He that is of God, heareth Gods words: ye therefore heare them not, because
b.JOH.8.48	Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, Say wee not well that thou art a
b.JOH.8.49	Iesus answered, I haue not a deuill: but I honour my Father, and ye doe
b.JOH.8.5	Now Moses in the Law commanded vs, that such should be stoned: but what sayest
b.JOH.8.50	And I seeke not mine owne glory, there is one that seeketh &amp; iudgeth.
b.JOH.8.51	Uerely, verely I say vnto you, If a man keepe my saying, hee shall neuer see
b.JOH.8.52	Then said the Iewes vnto him, Now we know that thou hast a deuill. Abraham is
b.JOH.8.53	Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are
b.JOH.8.54	Iesus answered, If I honour myselfe, my honour is nothing: it is my Father
b.JOH.8.55	Yet ye haue not knowen him, but I know him: and if I should say, I know him
b.JOH.8.56	Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day: and he saw it, &amp; was glad.
b.JOH.8.57	Then said the Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeeres olde, and hast
b.JOH.8.58	Iesus said vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Before Abraham was, I
b.JOH.8.59	Then tooke they vp stones to cast at him: but Iesus hidde himselfe, and went
b.JOH.8.6	This they said, tempting him, that they might haue to accuse him. But Iesus
b.JOH.8.7	So when they continued asking him, hee lift vp himselfe, and saide vnto them,
b.JOH.8.8	And againe, hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground.
b.JOH.8.9	And they which heard it, being conuicted by their owne conscience, went out
b.JOH.9.1	And as Iesus passed by, he saw a man which was blinde from his birth.
b.JOH.9.10	Therefore said they vnto him, How were thine eyes opened?
b.JOH.9.11	He answered and said, A man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed
b.JOH.9.12	Then said they vnto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
b.JOH.9.13	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
b.JOH.9.14	And it was the Sabbath day when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
b.JOH.9.15	Then againe the Pharisees also asked him how he had receiued his sight. He
b.JOH.9.16	Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because hee
b.JOH.9.17	They say vnto the blind man againe, What sayest thou of him, that he hath
b.JOH.9.18	But the Iewes did not beleeue concerning him, that hee had bin blind, and
b.JOH.9.19	And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, who ye say was borne blind?
b.JOH.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sinne, this man, or his
b.JOH.9.20	His parents answered them, and said, We know that this is our sonne, and that
b.JOH.9.21	But by what meanes he now seeth, we know not, or who hath opened his eyes we
b.JOH.9.22	These words spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes
b.JOH.9.23	Therefore said his parents, He is of age, aske him.
b.JOH.9.24	Then againe called they the man that was blind, and said vnto him, Giue God
b.JOH.9.25	He answered, and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: One thing I
b.JOH.9.26	Then saide they to him againe, What did he to thee? How opened hee thine
b.JOH.9.27	He answered them, I haue told you already, and ye did not heare: wherfore
b.JOH.9.28	Then they reuiled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are Moses
b.JOH.9.29	Wee know that God spake vnto Moses: as for this fellow, we knowe not from
b.JOH.9.3	Iesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the
b.JOH.9.30	The man answered, and said vnto them, Why herein is a marueilous thing, that
b.JOH.9.31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man bee a worshipper of
b.JOH.9.32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one
b.JOH.9.33	If this man were not of God, he could doe nothing.
b.JOH.9.34	They answered, and saide vnto him, Thou wast altogether borne in sinnes, and
b.JOH.9.35	Iesus heard that they had cast him out; and when hee had found him, he said
b.JOH.9.36	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue on him?
b.JOH.9.37	And Iesus said vnto him, Thou hast both seene him, and it is he that talketh
b.JOH.9.38	And he said, Lord, I beleeue: and he worshipped him.
b.JOH.9.39	And Iesus said, For iudgment I am come into this world, that they which see
b.JOH.9.4	I must worke the workes of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
b.JOH.9.40	And some of the Pharisees which were with him, heard these words, and saide
b.JOH.9.41	Iesus saide vnto them, If yee were blind, ye should haue no sinne: but now ye
b.JOH.9.5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
b.JOH.9.6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spettle,
b.JOH.9.7	And said vnto him, Goe wash in the poole of Siloam (which is by
b.JOH.9.8	The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seene him, that he was
b.JOH.9.9	Some said, This is hee: others said, Hee is like him: but hee sayd, I am hee.
b.JON.1.1	Now the word of the Lord came vnto Ionah the sonne of Amittai, saying,
b.JON.1.10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and saide vnto him; Why hast thou done
b.JON.1.11	Then said they vnto him, What shall we doe vnto thee, that the sea may be
b.JON.1.12	And he said vnto them, Take me vp, and cast mee foorth into the sea; so shall
b.JON.1.13	Neuerthelesse the men rowed hard to bring it to the land, but they could not:
b.JON.1.14	Wherefore they cried vnto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, We
b.JON.1.15	So they tooke vp Ionah, and cast him foorth into the sea, and the sea ceased
b.JON.1.16	Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice vnto the
b.JON.1.17	Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow vp Ionah, and Ionah was in
b.JON.1.2	Arise, goe to Nineueh that great citie, and cry against it: for their
b.JON.1.3	But Ionah rose vp to flee vnto Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord, and
b.JON.1.4	But the Lord sent out a great winde into the sea, and there was a mightie
b.JON.1.5	Then the Mariners were afraid, and cried euery man vnto his god, and cast
b.JON.1.6	So the shipmaster came to him, and said vnto him; What meanest thou, O
b.JON.1.7	And they said euery one to his fellow; Come, and let vs cast lots, that we may
b.JON.1.8	Then said they vnto him, Tel vs, we pray thee, for whose cause this euill is
b.JON.1.9	And hee said vnto them, I am an Hebrew, and I feare the Lord the God of heauen,
b.JON.2.1	Then Ionah prayed vnto the Lord his God, out of the fishes belly,
b.JON.2.10	And the Lord spake vnto the fish, and it vomited out Ionah vpon the drie
b.JON.2.2	And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction vnto the Lord, and hee heard
b.JON.2.3	For thou hadst cast mee into the deepe, in the middest of the Seas, and the
b.JON.2.4	Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will looke againe toward thy
b.JON.2.5	The waters compassed mee about euen to the soule; the depth closed mee round
b.JON.2.6	I went downe to the bottomes of the mountaines: the earth with her barres was
b.JON.2.7	When my soule fainted within mee, I remembred the Lord, and my prayer came in
b.JON.2.8	They that obserue lying vanities, forsake their owne mercy.
b.JON.2.9	But I wil sacrifice vnto thee with the voice of thanksgiuing, I will pay that
b.JON.3.1	And the word of ye Lord came vnto Ionah the second time, saying;
b.JON.3.10	And God saw their workes, that they turned from their euill way, and God
b.JON.3.2	Arise, goe vnto Nineueh that great citie, and preach vnto it the preaching
b.JON.3.3	So Ionah arose and went vnto Nineueh, according to the word of the Lord: now
b.JON.3.4	And Ionah began to enter into the citie a dayes iourney, and hee cryed, and
b.JON.3.5	So the people of Nineueh beleeued God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on
b.JON.3.6	For word came vnto the King of Nineueh, and he arose from his throne, and he
b.JON.3.7	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineueh (by the decree
b.JON.3.8	But let man and beast be couered with sackecloth, and cry mightily vnto God:
b.JON.3.9	Who can tell if God will turne and repent, and turne away from his fierce
b.JON.4.1	But it displeased Ionah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
b.JON.4.10	Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pitie on the gourde, for the which thou
b.JON.4.11	And should not I spare Nineueh that great citie, wherein are more then
b.JON.4.2	And he prayed vnto the Lord, and sayd, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my
b.JON.4.3	Therefore now, O Lord, Take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better
b.JON.4.4	Then said the Lord, Doest thou well to be angry?
b.JON.4.5	So Ionah went out of the citie, and sate on the East side of the city, and
b.JON.4.6	And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come vp ouer Ionah, that it
b.JON.4.7	But God prepared a worme when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the
b.JON.4.8	And it came to passe when the Sunne did arise, that God prepared a vehement
b.JON.4.9	And God said to Ionah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? and he said,
b.JOS.10.1	Now it came to passe when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem, had heard how Ioshua
b.JOS.10.10	And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slewe them with a great
b.JOS.10.11	And it came to passe as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going
b.JOS.10.12	Then spake Ioshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord deliuered vp the
b.JOS.10.13	And the Sunne stood still, and the Moone stayed, vntill the people had
b.JOS.10.14	And there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the Lord
b.JOS.10.15	And Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him, vnto the campe to Gilgal.
b.JOS.10.16	But these fiue kings fled, and hid themselues in a caue at Makkedah.
b.JOS.10.17	And it was told Ioshua, saying, The fiue kings are found hid in a caue at
b.JOS.10.18	And Ioshua said, Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men
b.JOS.10.19	And stay you not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of
b.JOS.10.2	That they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great citie, as one of the
b.JOS.10.20	And it came to passe when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an end
b.JOS.10.21	And all the people returned to the campe to Ioshua at Makkedah in peace: none
b.JOS.10.22	Then said Ioshua, Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out those fiue kings
b.JOS.10.23	And they did so, and brought forth those fiue kings vnto him out of the caue,
b.JOS.10.24	And it came to passe when they brought out those kings vnto Ioshua, that
b.JOS.10.25	And Ioshua said vnto them, Feare not, nor be dismaid, bee strong, and of good
b.JOS.10.26	And afterward Ioshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on fiue
b.JOS.10.27	And it came to passe at the time of the going downe of the Sunne, that Ioshua
b.JOS.10.28	And that day Ioshua tooke Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
b.JOS.10.29	Then Ioshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, vnto Libnah, and
b.JOS.10.3	Wherefore Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem, sent vnto Hoham King of Hebron, and
b.JOS.10.30	And the Lord deliuered it also and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel,
b.JOS.10.31	And Ioshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him, vnto Lachish, and
b.JOS.10.32	And the Lord deliuered Lachish into the hande of Israel, which tooke it on
b.JOS.10.33	Then Horam king of Gezer, came vp to helpe Lachish, and Ioshua smote him and
b.JOS.10.34	And from Lachish, Ioshua passed vnto Eglon, and all Israel with him, and they
b.JOS.10.35	And they tooke it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
b.JOS.10.36	And Ioshua went vp from Eglon, and all Israel with him, vnto Hebron, and they
b.JOS.10.37	And they tooke it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king
b.JOS.10.38	And Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against it.
b.JOS.10.39	And hee tooke it, and the King thereof, and all the cities thereof, and they
b.JOS.10.4	Come vp vnto me, and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made
b.JOS.10.40	So Ioshua smote all the countrey of the hils, and of the South, and of the
b.JOS.10.41	And Ioshua smote them from Kadesh-Barnea, euen vnto Gaza, and all the
b.JOS.10.42	And all these Kings and their land did Ioshua take at one time: because the
b.JOS.10.43	And Ioshua returned &amp; al Israel with him, vnto the campe to Gilgal.
b.JOS.10.5	Therefore the fiue Kings of the Amorites, the king of Ierusalem, the king of
b.JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua to the campe to Gilgal, saying, Slacke
b.JOS.10.7	So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and
b.JOS.10.8	And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Feare them not: for I haue deliuered them into
b.JOS.10.9	Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly, and went vp from Gilgal all night.
b.JOS.1.1	Nowe after the death of Moses the seruant of the Lord, it came to passe, that
b.JOS.1.10	Then Ioshua commanded the Officers of the people, saying,
b.JOS.1.11	Passe through the hoste, and command the people, saying, Prepare you
b.JOS.11.1	And it came to passe, when Iabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that
b.JOS.11.10	And Ioshua at that time turned backe, and tooke Hazor, and smote the king
b.JOS.11.11	And they smote all the soules that were therein with the edge of the sword,
b.JOS.11.12	And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Ioshua
b.JOS.11.13	But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none
b.JOS.11.14	And all the spoile of these cities, and the cattell, the children of Israel
b.JOS.11.15	As the Lord commanded Moses his seruant, so did Moses command Ioshua, and so
b.JOS.11.16	So Ioshua tooke all that land, the hilles, and all the South countrey, and
b.JOS.11.17	Euen from the mount Halak, that goeth vp to Seir, vnto Baal-Gad, in the
b.JOS.11.18	Ioshua made warre a long time, with all those kings.
b.JOS.11.19	There was not a citie that made peace with the children of Israel, saue the
b.JOS.1.12	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to halfe the tribe of
b.JOS.11.2	And to the kings that were on the North of the mountaines, and of the plaines
b.JOS.11.20	For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against
b.JOS.11.21	And at that time came Ioshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountaines,
b.JOS.11.22	There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel:
b.JOS.11.23	So Ioshua tooke the whole land according to all that the Lord saide vnto
b.JOS.1.13	Remember the word which Moses the seruant of the Lord commanded you, saying,
b.JOS.11.3	And to the Canaanite on the East and on the West, and to the Amorite, and the
b.JOS.1.14	Your wiues, your litle ones, and your cattell shall remaine in the lande
b.JOS.11.4	And they went out, they and all their hostes with them, much people, euen as
b.JOS.1.15	Untill the Lord haue giuen your brethren rest, as he hath giuen you, and they
b.JOS.11.5	And when all these Kings were met together, they came and pitched together at
b.JOS.1.16	And they answered Ioshua, saying, All that thou commandest vs, we will doe,
b.JOS.11.6	And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow
b.JOS.1.17	According as we hearkened vnto Moses in all things, so will we hearken vnto
b.JOS.11.7	So Ioshua came, and all the people of warre with him, against them by the
b.JOS.1.18	Whosoeuer he be that doth rebell against thy commandement, and will not
b.JOS.11.8	And the Lord deliuered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and
b.JOS.11.9	And Ioshua did vnto them as the Lord bade him: hee houghed their horses, and
b.JOS.1.2	Moses my seruant is dead: now therefore arise, goe ouer this Iordan, thou, and
b.JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and
b.JOS.12.10	The king of Ierusalem, one: the king of Hebron, one:
b.JOS.12.11	The king of Iarmuth, one: the king of Lachis, one:
b.JOS.12.12	The king of Eglon, one: the king of Gezer, one:

b.JOS.21.40	So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were
b.JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Leuites within the possession of the children of
b.JOS.21.42	These cities were euery one with their suburbs round about them: thus were

b.JOS.21.45	There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken vnto the

b.JOS.21.6	And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of
b.JOS.2.17	And the men said vnto her, Wee will bee blamelesse of this thine oath which
b.JOS.21.7	The children of Merari by their families, had out of the tribe of Reuben, and
b.JOS.2.18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt binde this line of scarlet
b.JOS.21.8	And the children of Israel gaue by lot vnto the Leuites these cities with
b.JOS.2.19	And it shall bee, that whosoeuer shall goe out of the doores of thy house
b.JOS.21.9	And they gaue out of the tribe of the children of Iudah, and out of the tribe
b.JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Iericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither
b.JOS.2.20	And if thou vtter this our businesse, then we wilbe quit of thine oath which
b.JOS.2.21	And shee saide, According vnto your words, so be it. And she sent them away,
b.JOS.22.1	Then Ioshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the halfe tribe of
b.JOS.22.10	And when they came vnto the borders of Iordan, that are in the land of
b.JOS.22.11	And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the
b.JOS.22.12	And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole Congregation of the
b.JOS.22.13	And the children of Israel sent vnto the children of Reuben, and to the
b.JOS.22.14	And with him ten princes, of ech chiefe house a prince, throughout all the
b.JOS.22.15	And they came vnto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to
b.JOS.22.16	Thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord, What trespasse is this that ye
b.JOS.22.17	Is the iniquitie of Peor too litle for vs, from which we are not cleansed
b.JOS.22.18	But that ye must turne away this day from following the Lord ? And it will
b.JOS.22.19	Notwithstanding, if the lande of your possession be vncleane, then passe yee
b.JOS.2.22	And they went, and came vnto the mountaine, and abode there three dayes,
b.JOS.22.2	And said vnto them, Yee haue kept all that Moses the seruant of the Lord
b.JOS.22.20	Did not Achan the sonne of Zerah commit a trespasse in the accursed thing,
b.JOS.22.21	Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the halfe tribe of
b.JOS.22.22	The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, hee knoweth, and Israel he shall
b.JOS.22.23	That wee haue built vs an altar to turne from following the Lord, or if to
b.JOS.22.24	And if we haue not rather done it for feare of this thing, saying, In time to
b.JOS.22.25	For the Lord hath made Iordan a border betweene vs and you, yee children of
b.JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, Let vs now prepare to build vs an altar, not for burnt
b.JOS.22.27	But that it may bee a witnesse betweene vs and you, and our generations after
b.JOS.22.28	Therefore said we, that it shalbe, when they should so say to vs, or to our
b.JOS.22.29	God forbid that we should rebell against the Lord, and turne this day from
b.JOS.2.23	So the two men returned, and descended from the mountaine, and passed ouer,
b.JOS.22.3	Yee haue not left your brethren these many dayes vnto this day, but haue kept
b.JOS.22.30	And when Phinehas the Priest and the Princes of the Congregation, and Heads
b.JOS.22.31	And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest said vnto the children of
b.JOS.22.32	And Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest, and the Princes, returned from
b.JOS.22.33	And the thing pleased the children of Israel, and the children of Israel
b.JOS.22.34	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for
b.JOS.2.24	And they saide vnto Ioshua, Truely the Lord hath deliuered into our hands all
b.JOS.22.4	And now the Lord your God hath giuen rest vnto your brethren, as hee promised
b.JOS.22.5	But take diligent heed, to doe the Commandement and the Law, which Moses the
b.JOS.22.6	So Ioshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went vnto their tents.
b.JOS.22.7	Now to the one halfe of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had giuen possession in
b.JOS.22.8	And he spake vnto them, saying; Returne with much riches vnto your tents, and
b.JOS.22.9	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the halfe tribe of
b.JOS.2.3	And the king of Iericho sent vnto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are
b.JOS.23.1	And it came to passe, a long time after that the Lord had giuen rest vnto
b.JOS.23.10	One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he it is that
b.JOS.23.11	Take good heed therefore vnto your selues, that ye loue the Lord your God.
b.JOS.23.12	Else, if ye do in any wise go backe, and cleaue vnto the remnant of these
b.JOS.23.13	Know for a certainety, that the Lord your God will no more driue out any of
b.JOS.23.14	And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth, and ye know in all
b.JOS.23.15	Therefore it shall come to passe, that as all good things are come vpon you,
b.JOS.23.16	When yee haue transgressed the Couenant of the Lord your God, which hee
b.JOS.23.2	And Ioshua called for all Israel, and for their Elders, &amp; for their Heads,
b.JOS.23.3	And yee haue seene all that the Lord your God hath done vnto all these
b.JOS.23.4	Behold, I haue diuided vnto you by lot these nations that remaine, to bee an
b.JOS.23.5	And the Lord your God, hee shall expell them from before you, and driue them
b.JOS.23.6	Be ye therefore very courageous to keepe and to doe all that is written in the
b.JOS.23.7	That yee come not among these nations, these that remaine amongst you, neither
b.JOS.23.8	But cleaue vnto the Lord your God, as yee haue done vnto this day.
b.JOS.23.9	For the Lord hath driuen out from before you, great nations, and strong: But
b.JOS.2.4	And the woman tooke the two men, and hid them, &amp; said thus: There came men
b.JOS.24.1	And Ioshua gathered all the Tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the
b.JOS.24.10	But I would not hearken vnto Balaam, therefore he blessed you still: so I
b.JOS.24.11	And ye went ouer Iordan, and came vnto Iericho: and the men of Iericho fought
b.JOS.24.12	And I sent the hornet before you, which draue them out from before you, euen
b.JOS.24.13	And I haue giuen you a land for which ye did not labour, &amp; cities which
b.JOS.24.14	Now therefore, feare the Lord, and serue him in sinceritie, and in trueth,
b.JOS.24.15	And if it seeme euill vnto you to serue the Lord, choose you this day whome
b.JOS.24.16	And the people answered and said, God forbid that wee should forsake the
b.JOS.24.17	For the Lord our God, he it is that brought vs vp and our fathers out of the
b.JOS.24.18	And the Lord draue out from before vs all the people, euen the Amorites which
b.JOS.24.19	And Ioshua said vnto the people, Ye cannot serue the Lord: for hee is an holy
b.JOS.24.2	And Ioshua said vnto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your
b.JOS.24.20	If yee forsake the Lord, and serue strange gods, then he will turne, and doe
b.JOS.24.21	And the people said vnto Ioshua, Nay, but we will serue the Lord.
b.JOS.24.22	And Ioshua said vnto the people, Yee are witnesses against your selues, that
b.JOS.24.23	Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and
b.JOS.24.24	And the people saide vnto Ioshua; The Lord our God will we serue, and his
b.JOS.24.25	So Ioshua made a couenant with the people that day, and set them a Statute,
b.JOS.24.26	And Ioshua wrote these words in the booke of the Law of God, and tooke a
b.JOS.24.27	And Ioshua saide vnto all the people, Behold, this stone shalbe a witnesse
b.JOS.24.28	So Ioshua let the people depart, euery man vnto his inheritance.
b.JOS.24.29	And it came to passe after these things, that Ioshua the sonne of Nun the
b.JOS.24.3	And I tooke your father Abraham fro the other side of the flood, and led him
b.JOS.24.30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, which
b.JOS.24.31	And Israel serued the Lord all the dayes of Ioshua, &amp; all the dayes of
b.JOS.24.32	And the bones of Ioseph, which the children of Israel brought vp out of
b.JOS.24.33	And Eleazar the sonne of Aaron died, and they buried him in a hill that
b.JOS.24.4	And I gaue vnto Isaac, Iacob and Esau: &amp; I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir, to
b.JOS.24.5	I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I
b.JOS.24.6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came vnto the sea, and the
b.JOS.24.7	And when they cried vnto the Lord, hee put darkenesse betweene you and the
b.JOS.24.8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side
b.JOS.24.9	Then Balak the sonne of Zippor king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel,
b.JOS.2.5	And it came to passe about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was darke,
b.JOS.2.6	But shee had brought them vp to the roofe of the house, and hid them with the
b.JOS.2.7	And the men pursued after them the way to Iordan, vnto the foords: and assoone
b.JOS.2.8	And before they were laide downe, shee came vp vnto them vpon the roofe.
b.JOS.2.9	And she said vnto the men, I know that the Lord hath giuen you the land, and
b.JOS.3.1	And Ioshua rose early in the morning, and they remooued from Shittim, and came
b.JOS.3.10	And Ioshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the liuing God is among you, and
b.JOS.3.11	Behold, the Arke of the Couenant, euen the Lord of all the earth, passeth
b.JOS.3.12	Now therefore take yee twelue men out of the Tribes of Israel, out of euery
b.JOS.3.13	And it shall come to passe, assoone as the soles of the feete of the Priestes
b.JOS.3.14	And it came to passe when the people remooued from their tents, to passe ouer
b.JOS.3.15	And as they that bare the Arke were come vnto Iordan, and the feet of the
b.JOS.3.16	That the waters which came downe from aboue, stood and rose vp vpon an heape
b.JOS.3.17	And the Priestes that bare the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord, stood firme
b.JOS.3.2	And it came to passe after three dayes, that the Officers went thorow the
b.JOS.3.3	And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the Arke of the Couenant of
b.JOS.3.4	Yet there shalbe a space betweene you and it, about two thousand cubites by
b.JOS.3.5	And Ioshua said vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues: for to morrow the Lord
b.JOS.3.6	And Ioshua spake vnto the Priests, saying, Take vp the Arke of the Couenant,
b.JOS.3.7	And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, This day wil I begin to magnifie thee in the
b.JOS.3.8	And thou shalt commaund the Priests that beare the Arke of the Couenant,
b.JOS.3.9	And Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel, Come hither, and heare the words
b.JOS.4.1	And it came to passe when all the people were cleane passed ouer Iordan, that
b.JOS.4.10	For the Priests which bare the Arke, stood in the midst of Iordan, vntill
b.JOS.4.11	And it came to passe when all the people were cleane passed ouer, that the
b.JOS.4.12	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and halfe the tribe of
b.JOS.4.13	About fourty thousand prepared for war, passed ouer before the Lord vnto
b.JOS.4.14	On that day the Lord magnified Ioshua in the sight of all Israel, and they
b.JOS.4.15	And the Lord spake vnto Ioshua, saying,
b.JOS.4.16	Command the Priests that beare the Arke of the Testimony, that they come vp
b.JOS.4.17	Ioshua therefore commaunded the Priests, saying, Come yee vp out of Iordan.
b.JOS.4.18	And it came to passe when the Priests that bare the Arke of the Couenant of
b.JOS.4.19	And the people came vp out of Iordan on the tenth day of the first moneth,
b.JOS.4.2	Take you twelue men out of the people, out of euery tribe a man,
b.JOS.4.20	And those twelue stones which they tooke out of Iordan, did Ioshua pitch in
b.JOS.4.21	And he spake vnto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shal
b.JOS.4.22	Then yee shall let your children know, saying, Israel came ouer this Iordan
b.JOS.4.23	For the Lord your God dried vp the waters of Iordan from before you, vntill
b.JOS.4.24	That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is
b.JOS.4.3	And command you them, saying, Take you hence out of the mids of Iordan, out of
b.JOS.4.4	Then Ioshua called the twelue men, whom he had prepared of the children of
b.JOS.4.5	And Ioshua said vnto them, Passe ouer before the Arke of the Lord your God
b.JOS.4.6	That this may be a signe among you, that when your children aske their fathers
b.JOS.4.7	Then yee shall answere them, That the waters of Iordan were cut off before the
b.JOS.4.8	And the children of Israel did so as Ioshua commanded, and tooke vp twelue
b.JOS.4.9	And Ioshua set vp twelue stones in the midst of Iordan, in the place where the
b.JOS.5.1	And it came to passe when all the Kings of the Amorites which were on the side
b.JOS.5.10	And the children of Israel incamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passeouer, on the
b.JOS.5.11	And they did eate of the olde corne of the land, on the morrow after the
b.JOS.5.12	And the Manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corne of
b.JOS.5.13	And it came to passe when Ioshua was by Iericho, that he lift vp his eyes,
b.JOS.5.14	And he said, Nay, but as captaine of the hoste of the Lord am I now come. And
b.JOS.5.15	And the captaine of the Lords hoste said vnto Ioshua, Loose thy shooe from
b.JOS.5.2	At that time the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Make thee sharpe kniues, and
b.JOS.5.3	And Ioshua made him sharpe kniues, and circumcised the children of Israel at
b.JOS.5.4	And this is the cause why Ioshua did circumcise: all the people that came out
b.JOS.5.5	Now all the people that came out, were circumcised, but all the people that
b.JOS.5.6	For the children of Israel walked fourtie yeeres in the wildernesse, till all
b.JOS.5.7	And their children, whom hee raised vp in their stead, them Ioshua
b.JOS.5.8	And it came to passe when they had done circumcising all the people, that they
b.JOS.5.9	And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, This day haue I rolled away the reproch of
b.JOS.6.1	Now Iericho was straitly shut vp, because of the children of Israel: none went
b.JOS.6.10	And Ioshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any
b.JOS.6.11	So the Arke of the Lord compassed the citie, going about it once: and they
b.JOS.6.12	And Ioshua rose earely in the morning, and the Priests tooke vp the Arke of
b.JOS.6.13	And seuen Priests bearing seuen trumpets of rammes hornes before the Arke of
b.JOS.6.14	And the second day they compassed the citie once, and returned into the campe:
b.JOS.6.15	And it came to passe on the seuenth day, that they rose early about the
b.JOS.6.16	And it came to passe at the seuenth time, when the Priests blewe with the
b.JOS.6.17	And the citie shalbe accursed, euen it, and all that are therein, to the
b.JOS.6.18	And you, in any wise keepe your selues from the accursed thing, lest yee make
b.JOS.6.19	But all the siluer, and gold, and vessels of brasse and yron, are consecrated
b.JOS.6.2	And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, See, I haue giuen into thine hand Iericho, and
b.JOS.6.20	So the people shouted when the Priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to
b.JOS.6.21	And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, yong
b.JOS.6.22	But Ioshua had said vnto the two men that had spied out the countrey; Goe
b.JOS.6.23	And the yong men that were spies, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her
b.JOS.6.24	And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: onely the siluer
b.JOS.6.25	And Ioshua saued Rahab the harlot aliue, and her fathers houshold, and all
b.JOS.6.26	And Ioshua adiured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the
b.JOS.6.27	So the Lord was with Ioshua, and his fame was noised throughout all the
b.JOS.6.3	And ye shall compasse the city, all yee men of warre, and goe round about the
b.JOS.6.4	And seuen Priests shall beare before the Arke seuen trumpets of rams hornes:
b.JOS.6.5	And it shall come to passe that when they make a long blast with the
b.JOS.6.6	And Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests, and said vnto them, Take vp
b.JOS.6.7	And he said vnto the people, Passe on, and compasse the city, and let him that
b.JOS.6.8	And it came to passe when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people, that the seuen
b.JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the Priests that blew with the trumpets: and the
b.JOS.7.1	And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Feare not, neither be thou dismaid: take all
b.JOS.7.1	But the children of Israel committed a trespasse in the accursed thing: for
b.JOS.7.10	And Ioshua rose vp early in the morning, and numbred the people, and went vp;
b.JOS.7.10	And the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Get thee vp; wherefore liest thou thus vpon
b.JOS.7.11	And all the people, euen the people of warre that were with him, went vp, and
b.JOS.7.11	Israel hath sinned, and they haue also transgressed my Couenant which I
b.JOS.7.12	And he tooke about fiue thousand men, and set them to lye in ambush betweene
b.JOS.7.12	Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but
b.JOS.7.13	And when they had set the people, euen all the hoste that was on the North of
b.JOS.7.13	Up, sanctifie the people, and say, Sanctifie your selues against to morrow:
b.JOS.7.14	And it came to passe when the King of Ai saw it, that they hasted, and rose
b.JOS.7.14	In the morning therefore ye shal be brought, according to your tribes: and it
b.JOS.7.15	And Ioshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled
b.JOS.7.15	And it shalbe that he that is taken with the accursed thing, shall bee burnt
b.JOS.7.16	And all the people that were in Ai, were called together to pursue after
b.JOS.7.16	So Ioshua rose vp earely in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes,
b.JOS.7.17	And hee brought the familie of Iudah, and he tooke the familie of the
b.JOS.7.17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel:
b.JOS.7.18	And hee brought his houshold, man by man, and Achan the sonne of Carmi, the
b.JOS.7.18	And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Stretch out the speare that is in thy hand,
b.JOS.7.19	And Ioshua said vnto Achan, My sonne, giue, I pray thee, glory to the Lord
b.JOS.7.19	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ranne as soone as
b.JOS.7.2	And Ioshua sent men from Iericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-auen, on the East
b.JOS.7.2	And thou shalt doe to Ai and her king, as thou diddest vnto Iericho and her
b.JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Ioshua, and said, Indeed I haue sinned against the Lord
b.JOS.7.20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of
b.JOS.7.21	And when Ioshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and
b.JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoiles a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred
b.JOS.7.22	And the other issued out of the citie against them, so they were in the midst
b.JOS.7.22	So Ioshua sent messengers, and they ran vnto the tent, and behold, it was hid
b.JOS.7.23	And the King of Ai they tooke aliue, and brought him to Ioshua.
b.JOS.7.23	And they tooke them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them vnto
b.JOS.7.24	And Ioshua and all Israel with him tooke Achan the sonne of Zerah, and the
b.JOS.7.24	And it came to passe when Israel had made an end of slaying all the
b.JOS.7.25	And Ioshua said, Why hast thou troubled vs? the Lord shall trouble thee this
b.JOS.7.25	And so it was that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelue
b.JOS.7.26	And they raised ouer him a great heape of stones vnto this day: so the Lord
b.JOS.7.26	For Ioshua drew not his hand backe wherewith hee stretched out the speare,
b.JOS.7.27	Onely the cattell, and the spoile of that city Israel tooke for a pray vnto
b.JOS.7.28	And Ioshua burnt Ai, and made it an heape for euer, euen a desolation vnto
b.JOS.7.29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree vntil euentide: and assoone as the
b.JOS.7.3	And they returned to Ioshua, and said vnto him, Let not all the people goe vp:
b.JOS.7.3	So Ioshua arose, and all the people of warre, to goe vp against Ai: and Ioshua
b.JOS.7.30	Then Ioshua built an Altar vnto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal,
b.JOS.7.31	As Moses the seruant of the Lord commaunded the children of Israel, as it is
b.JOS.7.32	And he wrote there vpon the stones a copie of the Lawe of Moses, which hee
b.JOS.7.33	And all Israel, and their Elders, and Officers, and their Iudges, stood on
b.JOS.7.34	And afterward hee read all the words of the Law, the blessings and cursings,
b.JOS.7.35	There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Ioshua read not
b.JOS.7.4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the citie,
b.JOS.7.4	So there went vp thither of the people about three thousand men, and they fled
b.JOS.7.5	And I, and all the people that are with mee, will approch vnto the citie: and
b.JOS.7.5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and sixe men: for they chased
b.JOS.7.6	And Ioshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth vpon his face, before the
b.JOS.7.6	(For they will come out after vs) till we haue drawen them from the citie; for
b.JOS.7.7	And Ioshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this
b.JOS.7.7	Then yee shall rise vp from the ambush, and seise vpon the citie: for the Lord
b.JOS.7.8	And it shall be when yee haue taken the citie, that ye shall set the citie on
b.JOS.7.8	Oh Lord! what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backes before their
b.JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land shall heare of it, and
b.JOS.7.9	Ioshua therefore sent them foorth, and they went to lie in ambush, and abode
b.JOS.9.1	And it came to passe when all the kings which were on this side Iordan in the

b.JOS.9.17	And the children of Israel iourneyed, and came vnto their cities on the third

b.JOS.9.2	That they gathered themselues together to fight with Ioshua, and with Israel,
b.JOS.9.20	This we will doe to them; wee will euen let them liue, lest wrath be vpon vs,
b.JOS.9.21	And the Princes said vnto them, Let them liue, (but let them bee hewers of
b.JOS.9.22	And Ioshua called for them, and he spake vnto them, saying, Wherefore haue ye
b.JOS.9.23	Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you bee freed from being
b.JOS.9.24	And they answered Ioshua, and said, Because it was certainely told thy

b.JOS.9.26	And so did he vnto them, and deliuered them out of the hand of the children
b.JOS.9.27	And Ioshua made them that day, hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the
b.JOS.9.3	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Ioshua had done vnto Iericho,
b.JOS.9.4	They did worke wilily, and went and made as if they had beene embassadours,
b.JOS.9.5	And old shooes and clowted vpon their feet, &amp; olde garments vpon them, and

b.JOS.9.9	And they said vnto him, From a very farre countrey thy seruants are come,

b.JUD.1.13	Raging waues of the sea, foming out their owne shame, wandring stars, to whom

b.LAM.1.1	How doeth the citie sit solitarie that was full of people? How is she become as
b.LAM.1.10	The aduersarie hath spread out his hand vpon all her pleasant things: for she

b.LAM.1.12	Is it nothing to you, all ye that passe by? Behold and see, if there be any
b.LAM.1.13	From aboue hath he sent fire into my bones, and it preuaileth against them:
b.LAM.1.14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and
b.LAM.1.15	The Lord hath troden vnder foot all my mightie men in the midst of me: he
b.LAM.1.16	For these things I weepe, mine eye, mine eye runneth downe with water,
b.LAM.1.17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the Lord
b.LAM.1.18	The Lord is righteous, for I haue rebelled against his commandement: heare, I
b.LAM.1.19	I called for my louers, but they deceiued me: my priests and mine elders gaue

b.LAM.1.3	Iudah is gone into captiuitie, because of affliction, and because of great
b.LAM.1.4	The wayes of Zion do mourne, because none come to the solemne feasts: all her
b.LAM.1.5	Her aduersaries are the chiefe, her enemies prosper: for the Lord hath
b.LAM.1.6	And from the daughter of Zion all her beautie is departed: her princes are
b.LAM.1.7	Ierusalem remembred in the dayes of her affliction, and of her miseries, all
b.LAM.1.8	Ierusalem hath grieuously sinned, therefore she is remoued: all that honoured
b.LAM.1.9	Her filthines is in her skirts, she remembreth not her last end, therfore she
b.LAM.2.1	How hath the Lord couered the daughter of Zion with a cloud, in his anger, and
b.LAM.2.10	The Elders of the daughter of Zion sit vpon the ground and keepe silence:
b.LAM.2.11	Mine eyes doe faile with teares: my bowels are troubled: my liuer is powred
b.LAM.2.12	They say to their mothers, Where is corne and wine? when they swooned as the
b.LAM.2.13	What thing shall I take to witnesse for thee? what thing shall I liken to
b.LAM.2.14	Thy Prophets haue seene vaine and foolish things for thee, and they haue not
b.LAM.2.15	All that passe by, clap their hands at thee: they hisse and wagge their head
b.LAM.2.16	All thine enemies haue opened their mouth against thee: they hisse and gnash
b.LAM.2.17	The Lord hath done that which he had deuised: he hath fulfilled his word that
b.LAM.2.18	Their heart cried vnto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let teares
b.LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches powre out thine
b.LAM.2.2	The Lord hath swallowed vp all the habitations of Iacob, and hath not pitied:
b.LAM.2.20	Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this: shal the women eat
b.LAM.2.21	The yong and the old lye on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my yong
b.LAM.2.22	Thou hast called as in a solemne day my terrours round about, so that in the
b.LAM.2.3	He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horne of Israel: he hath drawen
b.LAM.2.4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an
b.LAM.2.5	The Lord was an enemie: he hath swallowed vp Israel, hee hath swallowed vp all
b.LAM.2.6	And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden,
b.LAM.2.7	The Lord hath cast off his Altar: hee hath abhorred his Sanctuarie: he hath
b.LAM.2.8	The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath
b.LAM.2.9	Her gates are sunke into the ground: he hath destroyed and broken her barres:
b.LAM.3.1	I Am the man that hath seene affliction by the rod of his wrath.
b.LAM.3.10	He was vnto me as a Beare lying in waite, and as a Lion in secret places.
b.LAM.3.11	Hee hath turned aside my wayes, and pulled me in pieces: hee hath made me
b.LAM.3.12	He hath bent his bow, and set me as a marke for the arrow.
b.LAM.3.13	Hee hath caused the arrowes of his quiuer to enter into my reines.
b.LAM.3.14	I was a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.
b.LAM.3.15	Hee hath filled me with bitternesse, hee hath made me drunken with wormewood.
b.LAM.3.16	He hath also broken my teeth with grauell stones, hee hath couered me with
b.LAM.3.17	And thou hast remoued my soule farre off from peace: I forgate prosperitie.
b.LAM.3.18	And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord:
b.LAM.3.19	Remembring mine affliction and my miserie, the wormewood &amp; the gall.
b.LAM.3.2	He hath led me and brought mee into darkenesse, but not into light.
b.LAM.3.20	My soule hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
b.LAM.3.21	This I recall to my mind, therefore haue I hope.
b.LAM.3.22	It is of the Lords mercies that wee are not consumed, because his compassions
b.LAM.3.23	They are newe euery morning: great is thy faithfulnesse.
b.LAM.3.24	The Lord is my portion, sayth my soule, therefore will I hope in him.
b.LAM.3.25	The Lord is good vnto them that waite for him, to the soule that seeketh him.
b.LAM.3.26	It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the saluation of
b.LAM.3.27	It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth.
b.LAM.3.28	Hee sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because hee hath borne it vpon him.
b.LAM.3.29	He putteth his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
b.LAM.3.3	Surely against me is he turned, he turneth his hand against me all the day.
b.LAM.3.30	Hee giueth his cheeke to him that smiteth him, hee is filled full with
b.LAM.3.31	For the Lord will not cast off for euer.
b.LAM.3.32	But though hee cause griefe, yet will hee haue compassion according to the
b.LAM.3.33	For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieue the children of men.
b.LAM.3.34	To crush vnder his feete all the prisoners of the earth,
b.LAM.3.35	To turne aside the right of a man before the face of the most high,
b.LAM.3.36	To subuert a man in his cause, the Lord approoueth not.
b.LAM.3.37	Who is hee that sayth, and it commeth to passe, when the Lord commandeth it
b.LAM.3.38	Out of the mouth of the most hie proceedeth not euill and good?
b.LAM.3.39	Wherefore doeth a liuing man complaine, a man for the punishment of his
b.LAM.3.4	My flesh and my skinne hath he made old, he hath broken my bones.
b.LAM.3.40	Let vs search and try our waies, and turne againe to the Lord.
b.LAM.3.41	Let vs lift vp our heart with our hands vnto God in the heauens.
b.LAM.3.42	We haue transgressed, and haue rebelled, thou hast not pardoned.
b.LAM.3.43	Thou hast couered with anger, and persecuted vs: thou hast slaine, thou hast
b.LAM.3.44	Thou hast couered thy selfe with a cloud, that our prayer should not passe
b.LAM.3.45	Thou hast made vs as the offscouring and refuse in the middest of the people.
b.LAM.3.46	All our enemies haue opened their mouthes against vs.
b.LAM.3.47	Feare and a snare is come vpon vs, desolation and destruction.
b.LAM.3.48	Mine eye runneth downe with riuers of water, for the destruction of the
b.LAM.3.49	Mine eye trickleth downe and ceaseth not, without any intermission:
b.LAM.3.5	He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and trauel.
b.LAM.3.50	Till the Lord looke downe, and behold from heauen.
b.LAM.3.51	Mine eye affecteth mine heart, because of all the daughters of my city.
b.LAM.3.52	Mine enemies chased me sore like a bird, without cause.
b.LAM.3.53	They haue cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone vpon me.
b.LAM.3.54	Waters flowed ouer mine head, then I sayd, I am cut off.
b.LAM.3.55	I called vpon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.
b.LAM.3.56	Thou hast heard my voice, hide not thine eare at my breathing, at my crie.
b.LAM.3.57	Thou drewest neere in the day that I called vpon thee: thou saidst, Feare
b.LAM.3.58	O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soule, thou hast redeemed my life.
b.LAM.3.59	O Lord, thou hast seene my wrong, iudge thou my cause.
b.LAM.3.6	He hath set me in darke places, as they that be dead of old.
b.LAM.3.60	Thou hast seene all their vengeance; and all their imaginations against me.
b.LAM.3.61	Thou hast heard their reproch, O Lord, and all their imaginations against me:
b.LAM.3.62	The lippes of those that rose vp against me, and their deuice against me all
b.LAM.3.63	Behold, their sitting downe and their rising vp, I am their musicke.
b.LAM.3.64	Render vnto them a recompense, O Lord, according to the worke of their hands.
b.LAM.3.65	Giue them sorrow of heart, thy curse vnto them.
b.LAM.3.66	Persecute and destroy them in anger, from vnder the heauens of the Lord.
b.LAM.3.7	He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: hee hath made my chaine heauie.
b.LAM.3.8	Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
b.LAM.3.9	Hee hath inclosed my wayes with hewen stone: he hath made my pathes crooked.
b.LAM.4.1	How is the gold become dimme! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of
b.LAM.4.10	The hands of the pitifull women haue sodden their owne children, they were
b.LAM.4.11	The Lord hath accomplished his furie, he hath powred out his fierce anger,
b.LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not haue

b.LAM.4.14	They haue wandred as blind men in the streetes, they haue polluted themselues
b.LAM.4.15	They cryed vnto them; Depart yee, it is vncleane, depart, depart, touch not,
b.LAM.4.16	The anger of the Lord hath diuided them, he will no more regard them: they
b.LAM.4.17	As for vs, our eyes as yet failed for our vaine helpe: in our watching we
b.LAM.4.18	They hunt our steps that we cannot goe in our streets: our end is neere, our
b.LAM.4.19	Our persecutours are swifter then the eagles of the heauen: they pursued vs
b.LAM.4.2	The precious sonnes of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as
b.LAM.4.20	The breath of our nostrels, the anointed of the Lord was taken in their pits,
b.LAM.4.21	Reioyce and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the lande of Uz,
b.LAM.4.22	The punishment of thine iniquitie is accomplished, O daughter of Zion, he

b.LAM.4.4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaueth to the roofe of his mouth for thirst:
b.LAM.4.5	They that did feede delicatly, are desolate in the streetes: they that were

b.LAM.5.1	Remember, O Lord, what is come vpon vs: consider and beholde our reproch.
b.LAM.5.10	Our skinne was blacke like an ouen, because of the terrible famine.
b.LAM.5.11	They rauished the women in Zion, and the maides in the cities of Iudah.
b.LAM.5.12	Princes are hanged vp by their hand: the faces of Elders were not honoured.
b.LAM.5.13	They tooke the young men to grinde, and the children fell vnder the wood.
b.LAM.5.14	The Elders haue ceased from the gate, the young men from their musicke.
b.LAM.5.15	The ioy of our heart is ceased, our daunce is turned into mourning.
b.LAM.5.16	The crowne is fallen from our head: Woe vnto vs, that wee haue sinned.
b.LAM.5.17	For this our heart is faint, for these things our eyes are dimme.
b.LAM.5.18	Because of the mountaine of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walke vpon it.
b.LAM.5.19	Thou, O Lord, remainest for euer: thy throne from generation to generation.
b.LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliants.
b.LAM.5.20	Wherefore doest thou forget vs for euer, and forsake vs so long time?
b.LAM.5.21	Turne thou vs vnto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned: renew our dayes as
b.LAM.5.22	But thou hast vtterly reiected vs: thou art very wroth against vs.
b.LAM.5.3	We are orphanes and fatherlesse, our mothers are as widowes.
b.LAM.5.4	We haue drunken our water for money, our wood is sold vnto vs.
b.LAM.5.5	Our neckes are vnder persecution: we labour and haue no rest.
b.LAM.5.6	We haue giuen the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied
b.LAM.5.7	Our fathers haue sinned and are not, and wee haue borne their iniquities.
b.LAM.5.8	Seruants haue ruled ouer vs: there is none that doeth deliuer vs out of their

b.LEV.10.15	The heaue shoulder, and the waue breast shal they bring, with the offrings
b.LEV.10.16	And Moses diligently sought the goate of the sinne offering, and behold, it
b.LEV.10.17	Wherefore haue ye not eaten the sinne offering in the holy place, seeing it
b.LEV.10.18	Behold, the blood of it was not brought in, within the holy place: yee should

b.LEV.10.3	Then Moses said vnto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will bee
b.LEV.10.4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Uzziel, the vncle of

b.LEV.10.7	And ye shal not goe out from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,
b.LEV.10.8	And the Lord spake vnto Aaron, saying,
b.LEV.10.9	Doe not drinke wine nor strong drinke, thou, nor thy sonnes with thee, when ye

b.LUK.10.26	What is written in the law? how readest thou?
b.LUK.10.27	And he answering, said, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
b.LUK.10.28	And he said vnto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt liue.
b.LUK.10.29	But he willing to iustifie himselfe, said vnto Iesus, And who is my
b.LUK.10.3	Go your wayes: Behold, I send you forth as lambes among wolues.
b.LUK.10.30	And Iesus answering, said, A certaine man went downe from Hierusalem to
b.LUK.10.31	And by chaunce there came downe a certaine Priest that way, and when he saw
b.LUK.10.32	And likewise a Leuite, when hee was at the place, came and looked on him, and

b.LUK.10.35	And on the morrow when he departed, hee tooke out two pence, and gaue them to
b.LUK.10.36	Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour vnto him that fell
b.LUK.10.37	And he said, He that shewed mercie on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe, and
b.LUK.10.38	Now it came to passe, as they went, that he entred into a certaine village:
b.LUK.10.39	And shee had a sister called Mary, which also sate at Iesus feet, and heard
b.LUK.10.4	Cary
b.LUK.10.40	But Martha was cumbred about much seruing, and came to him, and said, Lord,
b.LUK.10.41	And Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, Martha, Martha, thou art carefull,
b.LUK.10.42	But one thing is needefull, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall

b.LUK.10.8	And into whatsoeuer citie yee enter, and they receiue you, eate such things as
b.LUK.10.9	And heale the sicke that are therein, and say vnto them, The kingdome of God
b.LUK.1.1	Forasmuch as many haue taken in hande to set foorth in order a declaration of
b.LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of
b.LUK.1.11	And there appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lord, standing on the right side
b.LUK.11.1	And it came to passe, that as he was praying in a certaine place, when hee
b.LUK.11.10	For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to
b.LUK.11.11	If a sonne shall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will hee giue him
b.LUK.11.12	Or if he shall aske an egge, will he offer him a scorpion?
b.LUK.11.13	If ye then, being euill, know how to giue good gifts vnto your children: how
b.LUK.11.14	And he was casting out a deuil, and it was dumbe. And it came to passe, when
b.LUK.11.15	But some of them said, Hee casteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of
b.LUK.11.16	And other tempting him, sought of him a signe from heauen.
b.LUK.11.17	But he knowing their thoughts, said vnto them, Euery kingdome diuided against
b.LUK.11.18	If Satan also be diuided against himselfe, how shall his kingdom stand?
b.LUK.11.19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your sonnes cast them out?
b.LUK.1.12	And when Zacharias sawe him, hee was troubled, and feare fell vpon him.
b.LUK.11.2	And hee said vnto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heauen,
b.LUK.11.20	But if I with the finger of God cast out deuils, no doubt the kingdome of God
b.LUK.11.21	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
b.LUK.11.22	But when a stronger then he shal come vpon him, and ouercome him, hee taketh
b.LUK.11.23	He that is not with me, is against me: and hee that gathereth not with me,
b.LUK.11.24	When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie
b.LUK.11.25	And when hee commeth, hee findeth it swept and garnished.
b.LUK.11.26	Then goeth he, and taketh to him seuen other spirits more wicked then
b.LUK.11.27	And it came to passe as hee spake these things, a certaine woman of the
b.LUK.11.28	But hee said, Yea, rather blessed are they that heare the word of God, and
b.LUK.11.29	And when the people were gathered thicke together, hee began to say, This is
b.LUK.1.13	But the Angel said vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard,
b.LUK.11.3	Giue vs day by day our dayly bread.
b.LUK.11.30	For as Ionas was a signe vnto the Nineuites, so shall also the Sonne of man
b.LUK.11.31	The Queene of the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with the men of this
b.LUK.11.32	The men of Nineue shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation, and
b.LUK.11.33	No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither
b.LUK.11.34	The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy
b.LUK.11.35	Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darknesse.
b.LUK.11.36	If thy whole body therefore be full of light, hauing no part darke, the whole
b.LUK.11.37	And as he spake, a certaine Pharise besought him to dine with him: and he
b.LUK.11.38	And when the Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had not first washed before
b.LUK.11.39	And the Lord said vnto him, Now doe ye Pharises make cleane the outside of
b.LUK.1.14	And thou shalt haue ioy and gladnesse, and many shall reioyce at his birth:
b.LUK.11.4	And forgiue vs our sinnes: for we also forgiue euery one that is indebted to
b.LUK.11.40	Yee fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is
b.LUK.11.41	But rather giue almes of such things as you haue: and behold, all things are
b.LUK.11.42	But woe vnto you Pharises: for ye tythe Mint and Rue, and all maner of herbes,
b.LUK.11.43	Woe vnto you Pharisees: for ye loue the vppermost seats in the Synagogues,
b.LUK.11.44	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye are as graues which
b.LUK.11.45	Then answered one of the Lawyers, and said vnto him, Master, thus saying,
b.LUK.11.46	And he said, Woe vnto you also ye lawyers: for ye lade men with burdens
b.LUK.11.47	Woe vnto you: for ye build the sepulchres of the Prophets, and your fathers
b.LUK.11.48	Truely ye beare witnesse that ye allowe the deeds of your fathers: for they
b.LUK.11.49	Therefore also said the wisedome of God, I wil send them Prophets and
b.LUK.1.15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shal drinke neither wine,
b.LUK.11.5	And he said vnto them, Which of you shall haue a friend, and shall goe vnto
b.LUK.11.50	That the blood of all the Prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the
b.LUK.11.51	From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which perished betweene
b.LUK.11.52	Woe vnto you Lawyers: for ye haue taken away the key of knowledge: ye entred
b.LUK.11.53	And as he said these things vnto them, the Scribes and the Pharisees began to
b.LUK.11.54	Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that
b.LUK.1.16	And many of the children of
b.LUK.11.6	For a friend of mine in his iourney is come to me, and I haue nothing to set
b.LUK.1.17	And hee shall goe before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turne the
b.LUK.11.7	And he from within shal answere and say, Trouble mee not, the doore is now
b.LUK.1.18	And Zacharias said vnto the Angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old
b.LUK.11.8	I say vnto you, Though he will not rise, and giue him, because he is his
b.LUK.1.19	And the Angel answering, said vnto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the
b.LUK.11.9	And I say vnto you, Aske, and it shalbe giuen you: seeke, and ye shal find:
b.LUK.1.2	Euen as they deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning were
b.LUK.1.20	And behold, thou shalt be dumbe, and not able to speake, vntill the day that
b.LUK.1.21	And the people waited for Zacharias, and maruelled that hee taried so long in
b.LUK.12.1	In the meane time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude
b.LUK.12.10	And whosoeuer shall speake a word against the Sonne of man, it shall be
b.LUK.12.11	And when they bring you vnto the Synagogues, and vnto Magistrates, &amp;
b.LUK.12.12	For the holy Ghost shal teach you in the same houre, what ye ought to say.
b.LUK.12.13	And one of the company saide vnto him, Master, speake to my brother, that he
b.LUK.12.14	And he said vnto him, Man, who made mee a iudge, or a diuider ouer you?
b.LUK.12.15	And he said vnto them, Take heed and beware of couetousnes: for a mans life
b.LUK.12.16	And he spake a parable vnto them, saying, The ground of a certaine rich man
b.LUK.12.17	And he thought within himselfe, saying, What shall I doe, because I haue no
b.LUK.12.18	And he said, This will I doe, I will pull downe my barnes, and build greater,
b.LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soule, Soule, thou hast much goods layd vp for many
b.LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speake vnto them: and they perceiued that
b.LUK.12.2	For there is nothing couered, that shall not be reuealed, neither hid, that
b.LUK.12.20	But God said vnto him, Thou foole, this night thy soule shal be required of
b.LUK.12.21	So is he that laieth vp treasure for himselfe, and is not rich towards God.
b.LUK.12.22	And he said vnto his disciples, Therefore I say vnto you, Take no thought for
b.LUK.12.23	The life is more then meate, and the body is more then raiment.
b.LUK.12.24	Consider the rauens, for they neither sow nor reape, which neither haue
b.LUK.12.25	And which of you with taking thought can adde to his stature one cubite?
b.LUK.12.26	If yee then bee not able to doe that thing which is least, why take yee
b.LUK.12.27	Consider the Lillies how they growe, they toile not; they spinne not: and yet
b.LUK.12.28	If then God so clothe the
b.LUK.12.29	And seeke not yee what yee shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, neither be ye
b.LUK.1.23	And it came to passe, that as soone as the dayes of his ministration were
b.LUK.12.3	Therefore, whatsoeuer yee haue spoken in darkenesse, shall bee heard in the
b.LUK.12.30	For all these things doe the nations of the world seeke after: and your
b.LUK.12.31	But rather seeke yee the kingdome of God, and all these things shall be added
b.LUK.12.32	Feare not, litle flocke, for it is your fathers good pleasure to giue you the
b.LUK.12.33	Sell that yee haue, and giue almes: prouide your selues bagges which waxe not
b.LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
b.LUK.12.35	Let your loines be girded about, and your lights burning,
b.LUK.12.36	And ye your selues like vnto men that waite for their Lord, when he will
b.LUK.12.37	Blessed are those seruants, whom the Lord when he commeth, shall find
b.LUK.12.38	And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and
b.LUK.12.39	And this know, that if the good man of the house had knowen what houre the
b.LUK.1.24	And after those dayes his wife
b.LUK.12.4	And I say vnto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and
b.LUK.12.40	Be yee therefore ready also: for the sonne of man commeth at an houre when
b.LUK.12.41	Then Peter said vnto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable vnto vs, or euen
b.LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, Who then is that faithfull and wise steward, whom his Lord
b.LUK.12.43	Blessed is that seruant, whom his Lord when he commeth, shall find so doing.
b.LUK.12.44	Of a trueth, I say vnto you, that hee will make him ruler ouer all that he
b.LUK.12.45	But and if that seruant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his comming and
b.LUK.12.46	The Lord of that seruant will come in a day when hee looketh not for him, and
b.LUK.12.47	And that seruant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himselfe,
b.LUK.12.48	But hee that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall bee
b.LUK.12.49	I am come to send fire on the earth, and what will I, if it be already
b.LUK.1.25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the dayes wherein he looked on me, to
b.LUK.12.5	But I will forewarne you whom you shall feare: Feare him, which after he hath
b.LUK.12.50	But I haue a baptisme to be baptized with, and how am I straitned till it be
b.LUK.12.51	Suppose yee that I am come to giue peace on earth? I tell you, Nay, but
b.LUK.12.52	For from henceforth there shalbe fiue in one house diuided, three against
b.LUK.12.53	The father shall bee diuided against the sonne, and the sonne against the
b.LUK.12.54	And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the West,
b.LUK.12.55	And when ye see the Southwind blow, ye say, There will be heat, and it
b.LUK.12.56	Ye hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the skie, and of the earth: but
b.LUK.12.57	Yea, and why euen of your selues iudge ye not what is right?
b.LUK.12.58	When thou goest with thine aduersary to the magistrate, as thou art in the
b.LUK.12.59	I tell thee, Thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast payd the very last
b.LUK.1.26	And in the sixt moneth, the Angel Gabriel was sent from God, vnto a citie of
b.LUK.12.6	Are not fiue sparrowes solde for two farthings, and not one of them is
b.LUK.1.27	To a virgine espoused to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid,
b.LUK.12.7	But euen the very haires of your head are all numbred: Feare not therefore, ye
b.LUK.1.28	And the Angel came in vnto her, and said, Haile thou that art highly fauoured,
b.LUK.12.8	Also I say vnto you, Whosoeuer shall confesse me before men, him shall the
b.LUK.1.29	And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her minde
b.LUK.12.9	But he that denieth me before men, shalbe denied before the Angels of God.
b.LUK.1.3	It seemed good to me also, hauing had perfect vnderstanding of things from the
b.LUK.1.30	And the Angel said vnto her, Feare not, Marie, for thou hast found fauour
b.LUK.1.31	And behold, thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and bring forth a sonne, and
b.LUK.13.1	There were present at that season, some that told him of the Galileans, whose
b.LUK.13.10	And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath.
b.LUK.13.11	And beholde, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmitie eighteene
b.LUK.13.12	And when Iesus saw her, he called her to him, and said vnto her, Woman, thou
b.LUK.13.13	And hee layd his handes on her, and immediatly she was made straight, and
b.LUK.13.14	And the ruler of the Synagogue answered with indignation, because that Iesus
b.LUK.13.15	The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doeth not each one of
b.LUK.13.16	And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound,
b.LUK.13.17	And when hee had said these things, all his aduersaries were ashamed: &amp;
b.LUK.13.18	Then said he, Unto what is the kingdome of God like? and whereunto shall I
b.LUK.13.19	It is like a graine of mustard seed, which a man tooke, and cast into his
b.LUK.1.32	He shall be great, and shall be called the sonne of the Highest, and the Lord
b.LUK.13.2	And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were
b.LUK.13.20	And againe hee said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God?
b.LUK.13.21	It is like leauen, which a woman tooke and hidde in three measures of meale,
b.LUK.13.22	And he went thorow the cities and villages, teaching and iourneying towards
b.LUK.13.23	Then said one vnto him, Lord, are there few that be saued? And he said vnto
b.LUK.13.24	Striue to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say vnto you, will seeke
b.LUK.13.25	When once the master of the house is risen vp, &amp; hath shut to the doore,
b.LUK.13.26	Then shall ye begin to say, Wee haue eaten and drunke in thy presence, and
b.LUK.13.27	But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me
b.LUK.13.28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when yee shall see Abraham, and
b.LUK.13.29	And they shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and
b.LUK.1.33	And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome
b.LUK.13.3	I tell you, Nay: but except yee repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
b.LUK.13.30	And behold, there are last, which shall be first; and there are first, which
b.LUK.13.31	The same day there came certaine of the Pharises, saying vnto him, Get thee
b.LUK.13.32	And he said vnto them, Go ye and tell that Foxe, behold, I cast out deuils,
b.LUK.13.33	Neuerthelesse, I must walke to day and to morrow, and the day following: for
b.LUK.13.34	O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that
b.LUK.13.35	Behold, your house is left vnto you desolate. And verely I say vnto you, ye
b.LUK.1.34	Then said Marie vnto the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
b.LUK.13.4	Or those eighteene, vpon whom the towre in Siloe fell, and slew them, thinke
b.LUK.1.35	And the Angel answered and said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come vpon
b.LUK.13.5	I tell you, Nay; but except yee repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
b.LUK.1.36	And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her old
b.LUK.13.6	Hee spake also this parable, A certaine man had a figtree planted in his
b.LUK.1.37	For with God no thing shall be vnpossible.
b.LUK.13.7	Then said hee vnto the dresser of his Uineyard, Beholde, these three yeeres I
b.LUK.1.38	And Marie said, Behold the handmaide of the Lord, be it vnto me according to
b.LUK.13.8	And he answering, said vnto him, Lord, let it alone this yeere also, till I
b.LUK.1.39	And Marie arose in those dayes, and went into the hill countrey with haste,
b.LUK.13.9	And if it beare fruit, Well: and if not, then after that, thou shalt cut it
b.LUK.1.4	That thou mightest know the certainetie of those things wherein thou hast bene
b.LUK.1.40	And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.
b.LUK.1.41	And it came to passe that when
b.LUK.14.1	And it came to passe, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharises
b.LUK.14.10	But when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roume, that when he
b.LUK.14.11	For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shalbe abased: and hee that humbleth
b.LUK.14.12	Then said hee also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a
b.LUK.14.13	But when thou makest a feast, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, the
b.LUK.14.14	And thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be
b.LUK.14.15	And when one of them that sate at meate with him, heard these things, he said
b.LUK.14.16	Then said hee vnto him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many:
b.LUK.14.17	And sent his seruant at supper time, to say to them that were bidden, Come,
b.LUK.14.18	And they all with one consent began to make excuse: The first said vnto him,
b.LUK.14.19	And another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to prooue them:
b.LUK.1.42	And she spake out with a loud voyce, and saide, Blessed art thou among women,
b.LUK.14.2	And behold, there was a certaine man before him, which had the dropsie.
b.LUK.14.20	And another said, I haue maried a wife: and therefore I cannot come.
b.LUK.14.21	So that seruant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of
b.LUK.14.22	And the seruant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there
b.LUK.14.23	And the Lord said vnto the seruant, Goe out into the high wayes and hedges,
b.LUK.14.24	For I say vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of
b.LUK.14.25	And there went great multitudes with him: and hee turned, and said vnto them,
b.LUK.14.26	If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
b.LUK.14.27	And whosoeuer doeth not beare his crosse, and come after me, cannot be my
b.LUK.14.28	For which of you intending to build a towre, sitteth not downe first, and
b.LUK.14.29	Lest haply after hee hath laide the foundation, and is not able to finish it,
b.LUK.1.43	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to mee?
b.LUK.14.3	And Iesus answering, spake vnto the Lawyers and Pharises, saying, Is it
b.LUK.14.30	Saying, This man beganne to build, and was not able to finish.
b.LUK.14.31	Or what king going to make war against another king, sitteth not downe first,
b.LUK.14.32	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage,
b.LUK.14.33	So likewise, whosoeuer he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he
b.LUK.14.34	Salt is good: but if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it be
b.LUK.14.35	It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill: but men cast it
b.LUK.1.44	For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the
b.LUK.14.4	And they held their peace. And he tooke him, and healed him, &amp; let him go,
b.LUK.1.45	And blessed is she that beleeued, for there shalbe a performance of those
b.LUK.14.5	And answered them, saying, Which of you shall haue an asse or an oxe fallen
b.LUK.1.46	And Marie said, My soule doth magnifie the Lord.
b.LUK.14.6	And they could not answere him againe to these things.
b.LUK.1.47	And my spirit hath reioyced in God my sauiour.
b.LUK.14.7	And he put foorth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked howe
b.LUK.1.48	For hee hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold, from
b.LUK.14.8	When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not downe in the highest
b.LUK.1.49	For he that is mighty hath done to mee great things, and holy is his Name.
b.LUK.14.9	And hee that bade thee and him, come, and say to thee, Giue this man place:
b.LUK.1.5	There was in the dayes of Herode the king of Iudea, a certaine Priest, named
b.LUK.1.50	And his mercy is on them that feare him, from generation to generation.
b.LUK.1.51	Hee hath shewed strength with his arme, he hath scattered the proud, in the
b.LUK.15.1	Then drew neere vnto him all the Publicanes and sinners, for to heare him.
b.LUK.15.10	Likewise I say vnto you, there is ioy in the presence of the Angels of God,
b.LUK.15.11	And hee said, A certaine man had two sonnes:
b.LUK.15.12	And the yonger of them said to his father, Father, giue me the portion of
b.LUK.15.13	And not many dayes after, the yonger sonne gathered al together, and tooke
b.LUK.15.14	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land, and he
b.LUK.15.15	And he went and ioyned himselfe to a citizen of that countrey, and he sent
b.LUK.15.16	And he would faine haue filled his belly with the huskes that the swine did
b.LUK.15.17	And when he came to himselfe, he said, How many hired seruants of my fathers
b.LUK.15.18	I will arise and goe to my father, and will say vnto him, Father, I haue
b.LUK.15.19	And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired
b.LUK.1.52	He hath put downe the mighty from their seates, and exalted them of low
b.LUK.15.2	And the Pharises and Scribes murmured, murmured, saying, This man receiueth
b.LUK.15.20	And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his
b.LUK.15.21	And the sonne said vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and in thy
b.LUK.15.22	But the father saide to his seruants, Bring foorth the best robe, and put it
b.LUK.15.23	And bring hither the fatted calfe, and kill it, and let vs eate and be merrie.
b.LUK.15.24	For this my sonne was dead, and is aliue againe; hee was lost, &amp; is
b.LUK.15.25	Now his elder sonne was in the field, and as he came and drew nigh to the
b.LUK.15.26	And he called one of the seruants, and asked what these things meant.
b.LUK.15.27	And he said vnto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the
b.LUK.15.28	And he was angry, and would not goe in: therefore came his father out, and
b.LUK.15.29	And he answering said to his father, Loe, these many yeeres doe I serue thee,
b.LUK.1.53	Hee hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich hee hath sent
b.LUK.15.3	And he spake this parable vnto them, saying,
b.LUK.15.30	But as soone as this thy sonne was come, which hath deuoured thy liuing with
b.LUK.15.31	And he said vnto him, Sonne, thou art euer with me, and all that I haue is
b.LUK.15.32	It was meete that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was
b.LUK.1.54	Hee hath holpen his seruant
b.LUK.15.4	What man of you hauing an hundred sheepe, if he loose one of them, doth not
b.LUK.1.55	As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for euer.
b.LUK.15.5	And when he hath found it, hee layeth it on his shoulders, reioycing.
b.LUK.1.56	And Mary abode with her about three moneths, and returned to her owne house.
b.LUK.15.6	And when he commeth home, he calleth together his friends, and neighbours,
b.LUK.1.57	Now
b.LUK.15.7	I say vnto you, that likewise ioy shall be in heauen ouer one sinner that
b.LUK.1.58	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy
b.LUK.15.8	Either what woman hauing ten pieces of siluer, if she lose one piece, doth not

b.LUK.15.9	And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours
b.LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements and

b.LUK.1.61	And they said vnto her, There is none of thy kinred that is called by this
b.LUK.16.1	And hee said also vnto his disciples, There was a certaine rich man which had
b.LUK.16.10	Hee that is faithfull in that which is least, is faithfull also in much: and
b.LUK.16.11	If therefore yee haue not bene faithfull in the vnrighteous Mammon, who will

b.LUK.16.13	No seruant can serue two masters, for either he will hate the one, and loue
b.LUK.16.14	And the Pharisees also who were couetous, heard all these things: and they
b.LUK.16.15	And he said vnto them, Ye are they which iustifie your selues before men, but
b.LUK.16.16	The law and the Prophets were vntill Iohn: since that time the kingdome of
b.LUK.16.17	And it is easier for heauen and earth to passe, then one title of the law to
b.LUK.16.18	Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, &amp; marrieth another, committeth adultery:
b.LUK.16.19	There was a certaine rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linnen,
b.LUK.1.62	And they made signes to his father, how he would haue him called.
b.LUK.16.2	And hee called him, and said vnto him, How is it that I heare this of thee?
b.LUK.16.20	And there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was layde at his gate
b.LUK.16.21	And desiring to bee fed with the crummes which fel from the rich mans table:
b.LUK.16.22	And it came to passe that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into
b.LUK.16.23	And in hell he lift vp his eyes being in torments, and seeth Abraham afarre
b.LUK.16.24	And he cried, and said, Father Abraham, haue mercy on mee, and send Lazarus,
b.LUK.16.25	But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life-time receiuedst thy
b.LUK.16.26	And besides all this, betweene vs and you there is a great gulfe fixed, so
b.LUK.16.27	Then he said, I pray thee therefore father, that thou wouldest send him to my
b.LUK.16.28	For I haue fiue brethren, that he may testifie vnto them, lest they also come
b.LUK.16.29	Abraham saith vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets, let them heare
b.LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn: and
b.LUK.16.3	Then the Steward said within himselfe, What shall I doe, for my lord taketh
b.LUK.16.30	And hee said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went vnto them from the dead,
b.LUK.16.31	And hee said vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will
b.LUK.1.64	And his mouth was opened immediatly, and his tongue loosed, and hee spake,
b.LUK.16.4	I am resolued what to doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may
b.LUK.1.65	And feare came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these sayings were
b.LUK.16.5	So hee called euery one of his lords detters vnto him, and said vnto the
b.LUK.1.66	And all they that had heard them, layde them vp in their hearts, saying, What
b.LUK.16.6	And hee said, An hundred measures of oyle. And hee saide vnto him, Take thy
b.LUK.1.67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied,
b.LUK.16.7	Then said hee to another, And how much owest thou? And hee said, An hundred
b.LUK.1.68	Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel, for hee hath visited and redeemed his
b.LUK.16.8	And the lord commended the vniust Steward, because he had done wisely: for the
b.LUK.1.69	And hath raised vp an horne of saluation for vs, in the house of his seruant
b.LUK.16.9	And I say vnto you, Make to your selues friends of the Mammon of
b.LUK.1.7	And they had no childe, because that
b.LUK.1.70	As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which haue bene since the
b.LUK.1.71	That wee should be saued from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate
b.LUK.17.1	Then said he vnto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come,
b.LUK.17.10	So likewise ye, when ye shal haue done all those things which are commanded
b.LUK.17.11	And it came to passe, as he went to Hierusalem, that hee passed thorow the
b.LUK.17.12	And as he entred into a certaine village, there met him tenne men that were
b.LUK.17.13	And they lifted vp their voices, and said, Iesus master haue mercy on vs.
b.LUK.17.14	And when he saw them, hee said vnto them, Goe shew your selues vnto the
b.LUK.17.15	And one of them when hee sawe that he was healed, turned backe, and with a
b.LUK.17.16	And fell downe on his face at his feet, giuing him thanks: and he was a
b.LUK.17.17	And Iesus answering, said, Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the
b.LUK.17.18	There are not found that returned to giue glory to God, saue this stranger.
b.LUK.17.19	And he said vnto him, Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.
b.LUK.1.72	To performe the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy
b.LUK.17.2	It were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his necke, and he
b.LUK.17.20	And when hee was demanded of the Pharises, when the kingdome of God should
b.LUK.17.21	Neither shall they say, Loe here, or loe there: for behold, the kingdome of
b.LUK.17.22	And hee said vnto the disciples, The dayes will come, when ye shall desire to
b.LUK.17.23	And they shall say to you, See here, or see there: Goe not after them, nor
b.LUK.17.24	For as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen,
b.LUK.17.25	But first must hee suffer many things, &amp; be reiected of this generation.
b.LUK.17.26	And as it was in the dayes of Noe: so shal it be also in the dayes of the
b.LUK.17.27	They did eate, they dranke, they married wiues, they were giuen in mariage,
b.LUK.17.28	Likewise also as it was in the dayes of Lot, they did eat, they dranke, they

b.LUK.1.73	The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
b.LUK.17.3	Take heed to your selues: If thy brother trespasse against thee, rebuke him,
b.LUK.17.30	Euen thus shall it bee in the day when the Sonne of man is reuealed.
b.LUK.17.31	In that day he which shall be vpon the house top, and his stuffe in the

b.LUK.17.33	Whosoeuer shall seeke to saue his life, shall lose it, and whosoeuer shall
b.LUK.17.34	I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shal be
b.LUK.17.35	Two women shall bee grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other
b.LUK.17.36	Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
b.LUK.17.37	And they answered, and said vnto him, Where, Lord? And he said vnto them,
b.LUK.1.74	That hee would grant vnto vs, that wee beeing deliuered out of the hands of
b.LUK.17.4	And if hee trespasse against thee seuen times in a day, and seuen times in a
b.LUK.1.75	In holinesse and righteousnesse before him, all the dayes of our life.
b.LUK.17.5	And the Apostles said vnto the Lord, Increase our faith.
b.LUK.1.76	And thou childe shalt bee called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt

b.LUK.17.7	But which of you hauing a seruant plowing, or feeding cattell, will say vnto
b.LUK.1.78	Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath
b.LUK.17.8	And will not rather say vnto him, Make ready wherewith I may suppe, and gird
b.LUK.1.79	To giue light to them that sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death, to
b.LUK.17.9	Doeth he thanke that seruant, because hee did the things that were commanded
b.LUK.1.8	And it came to passe, that while he executed the Priests office before God in
b.LUK.1.80	And the childe grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till
b.LUK.18.1	And he spake a parable vnto them, to this ende, that men ought alwayes to
b.LUK.18.10	Two men went vp into the
b.LUK.18.11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himselfe, God, I thank thee, that I
b.LUK.18.12	I fast twise in the weeke, I giue tithes of all that I possesse.
b.LUK.18.13	And the Publicane standing afarre off, would not lift vp so much as his eyes
b.LUK.18.14	I tell you, this man went downe to his house iustified rather then the other:
b.LUK.18.15	And they brought vnto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when
b.LUK.18.16	But Iesus called them vnto him, and said, Suffer litle children to come vnto
b.LUK.18.17	Uerely I say vnto you, whosoeuer shall not receiue the kingdome of God as a
b.LUK.18.18	And a certaine ruler asked him, saying, Good master, what shall I doe to
b.LUK.18.19	And Iesus said vnto him, Why callest thou mee good? None is good saue one,
b.LUK.18.2	Saying, There was in a city a Iudge, which feared not God neither regarded
b.LUK.18.20	Thou knowest the commaundements, Doe not commit adulterie, Doe not kill, Doe
b.LUK.18.21	And he said, All these haue I kept from my youth vp.
b.LUK.18.22	Now when Iesus heard these things, hee said vnto him, Yet lackest thou one
b.LUK.18.23	And when he heard this, he was very sorowfull, for he was very rich.
b.LUK.18.24	And when Iesus saw that hee was very sorrowfull, he said, How hardly shal
b.LUK.18.25	For it is easier for a camel to goe thorow a needles eye, then for a rich man
b.LUK.18.26	And they that heard it, said, Who then can be saued?
b.LUK.18.27	And he said, The things which are vnpossible with men, are possible with God.
b.LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, Loe, we haue left all, and followed thee.
b.LUK.18.29	And he said vnto them, Uerily, I say vnto you, there is no man that hath left
b.LUK.18.3	And there was a widowe in that citie, and she came vnto him, saying, Auenge me
b.LUK.18.30	Who shall not receiue manifold more in this present time, and in the world to
b.LUK.18.31	Then hee tooke vnto him the twelue, and said vnto them, Behold, we goe vp to
b.LUK.18.32	For he shall be deliuered vnto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and
b.LUK.18.33	And they shall scourge him, and put him to death, and the third day he shall
b.LUK.18.34	And they vnderstood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them,
b.LUK.18.35	And it came to passe, that as he was come nigh vnto Iericho, a certaine
b.LUK.18.36	And hearing the multitude passe by, he asked what it meant.
b.LUK.18.37	And they tolde him that Iesus of Nazareth passeth by.
b.LUK.18.38	And he cried, saying, Iesus thou sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on me.
b.LUK.18.39	And they which went before, rebuked him, that hee should holde his peace: but
b.LUK.18.4	And hee would not for a while. But afterward he said within himselfe, Though I
b.LUK.18.40	And Iesus stood and commanded him to be brought vnto him: and when he was
b.LUK.18.41	Saying, What wilt thou that I shall doe vnto thee? And he said, Lord, that I
b.LUK.18.42	And Iesus said vnto him, Receiue thy sight, thy faith hath saued thee.
b.LUK.18.43	And immediately he receiued his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and
b.LUK.18.5	Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will auenge her, lest by her continuall
b.LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, Heare what the vniust iudge saith.
b.LUK.18.7	And shall not God auenge his owne elect, which crie day and night vnto him,
b.LUK.18.8	I tell you that he wil auenge them speedily. Neuerthelesse, when the Son of
b.LUK.18.9	And he spake this parable vnto certaine which trusted in themselues that they
b.LUK.1.9	According to the custome of the Priests office, his lot was to burne incense
b.LUK.19.1	And Iesus entred, and passed thorow Iericho.
b.LUK.19.10	For the sonne of man is come to seeke, and to saue that which was lost.
b.LUK.19.11	And as they heard these things, he added, and spake a parable, because he was
b.LUK.19.12	He said therefore, A certaine noble man went into a farre countrey, to
b.LUK.19.13	And hee called his ten seruants, and deliuered them ten pounds, and said vnto
b.LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We wil not
b.LUK.19.15	And it came to passe, that when he was returned, hauing receiued the kingdome,
b.LUK.19.16	Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
b.LUK.19.17	And he said vnto him, Well, thou good seruant: because thou hast bene
b.LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained fiue pounds.
b.LUK.19.19	And hee said likewise to him, Bee thou also ouer fiue cities.
b.LUK.19.2	And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, which was the cheefe among the
b.LUK.19.20	And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound which I haue kept
b.LUK.19.21	For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest vp that thou
b.LUK.19.22	And hee saith vnto him, Out of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, thou
b.LUK.19.23	Wherefore then gauest not thou my money into the bancke, that at my comming I
b.LUK.19.24	And he said vnto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and giue it to
b.LUK.19.25	And they said vnto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.
b.LUK.19.26	For I say vnto you, That vnto euery one which hath, shalbe giuen, and from
b.LUK.19.27	But those mine enemies which would not that I should reigne ouer them, bring
b.LUK.19.28	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending vp to Hierusalem.
b.LUK.19.29	And it came to passe when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethanie, at the
b.LUK.19.3	And he sought to see Iesus who he was, and could not for the prease, because
b.LUK.19.30	Saying, Goe ye into the village ouer against you, in the which at your
b.LUK.19.31	And if any man aske you, Why do ye loose him? Thus shall ye say vnto him,
b.LUK.19.32	And they that were sent, went their way, and found euen as hee had said vnto
b.LUK.19.33	And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said vnto them, Why
b.LUK.19.34	And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
b.LUK.19.35	And they brought him to Iesus: and they cast their garments vpon the Colt,
b.LUK.19.36	And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
b.LUK.19.37	And when he was come nigh euen now at the descent of the mount of Oliues, the
b.LUK.19.38	Saying, Blessed bee the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord, peace in
b.LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude saide vnto him, Master,
b.LUK.19.4	And he ranne before, and climed vp into a sycomore tree to see him, for he was
b.LUK.19.40	And he answered, and said vnto them, I tell you, that if these should holde
b.LUK.19.41	And when he was come neere, he beheld the city and wept ouer it,
b.LUK.19.42	Saying, If thou hadst knowen, euen thou, at least in this thy day, the things
b.LUK.19.43	For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench
b.LUK.19.44	And shall lay thee euen with the ground, and thy children within thee: and
b.LUK.19.45	And he went into the
b.LUK.19.46	Saying vnto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye haue
b.LUK.19.47	And he taught daily in the
b.LUK.19.48	And could not finde what they might doe: for all the people were very
b.LUK.19.5	And when Iesus came to the place, he looked vp and saw him, and said vnto him,
b.LUK.19.6	And he made haste, and came downe, and receiued him ioyfully.
b.LUK.19.7	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest
b.LUK.19.8	And Zacheus stood, and said vnto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the halfe of my goods
b.LUK.19.9	And Iesus said vnto him, This day is saluation come to this house, forsomuch
b.LUK.20.1	And it came to passe, that on one of those dayes, as he taught the people in
b.LUK.20.10	And at the season, hee sent a seruant to the husbandmen, that they should
b.LUK.20.11	And againe hee sent another seruant, and they beat him also, and entreated
b.LUK.20.12	And againe he sent the third, and they wounded him also, &amp; cast him out.
b.LUK.20.13	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send my beloued
b.LUK.20.14	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselues, saying, This
b.LUK.20.15	So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall
b.LUK.20.16	Hee shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall giue the vineyard to
b.LUK.20.17	And hee beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone
b.LUK.20.18	Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone, shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it
b.LUK.20.19	And the chiefe Priests and the Scribes the same houre sought to lay hands on
b.LUK.20.2	And spake vnto him, saying, Tell vs, by what authoritie doest thou these
b.LUK.20.20	And they watched him, and sent foorth spies, which should faine themselues
b.LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest
b.LUK.20.22	Is it lawfull for vs to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or no?
b.LUK.20.23	But he perceiued their craftines, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me?
b.LUK.20.24	Shew me a peny: whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and
b.LUK.20.25	And he said vnto them, Render therefore vnto Cesar the things which be Cesars,
b.LUK.20.26	And they could not take holde of his wordes before the people, and they
b.LUK.20.27	Then came to him certaine of the Sadduces (which denie that there is any
b.LUK.20.28	Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die, hauing a wife,
b.LUK.20.29	There were therefore seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and died
b.LUK.20.3	And hee answered, and said vnto them, I will also aske you one thing, and
b.LUK.20.30	And the second tooke her to wife, and he died childlesse.
b.LUK.20.31	And the third tooke her, and in like maner the seuen also. And they left no
b.LUK.20.32	Last of all the woman died also.
b.LUK.20.33	Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? for seuen had her
b.LUK.20.34	And Iesus answering, said vnto them, The children of this world, marrie, and
b.LUK.20.35	But they which shall be accompted worthy to obtaine that world, and the
b.LUK.20.36	Neither can they die any more; for they are equall vnto the Angels, and are
b.LUK.20.37	Now that the dead are raised, euen Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth
b.LUK.20.38	For he is not a God of the dead, but of the liuing for all liue vnto him.
b.LUK.20.39	Then certaine of the Scribes answering, said, Master, Thou hast well said.
b.LUK.20.4	The Baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men?
b.LUK.20.40	And after that, they durst not aske him any question at all.
b.LUK.20.41	And he said vnto them, How say they that Christ is Dauids sonne?
b.LUK.20.42	And Dauid himselfe saith in the booke of Psalmes, The Lord said to my Lord,
b.LUK.20.43	Till I make thine enemies thy footestoole.
b.LUK.20.44	Dauid therefore calleth him, Lord, how is he then his sonne?
b.LUK.20.45	Then in the audience of all the people, he said vnto his disciples,
b.LUK.20.46	Beware of the Scribes, which desire to walke in long robes, and loue
b.LUK.20.47	Which deuoure widowes houses and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall
b.LUK.20.5	And they reasoned with themselues, saying, If wee shall say, From heauen, he
b.LUK.20.6	But and if we say, Of men, all the people will stone vs: for they be perswaded
b.LUK.20.7	And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
b.LUK.20.8	And Iesus said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these
b.LUK.20.9	Then began hee to speake to the people this parable: A certaine man planted a
b.LUK.2.1	And it came to passe in those dayes, that there went out a decree from Cesar
b.LUK.2.10	And the Angel said vnto them, Feare not: For behold, I bring you good tidings
b.LUK.2.11	For vnto you is borne this day, in the citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is
b.LUK.21.1	And he looked vp, and saw the rich men casting their giftes into the treasurie.
b.LUK.21.10	Then said he vnto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome
b.LUK.21.11	And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places, and famines, and
b.LUK.21.12	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you,
b.LUK.21.13	And it shall turne to you for a testimony.
b.LUK.21.14	Settle it therfore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall
b.LUK.21.15	For I will giue you a mouth and wisedome, which all your aduersaries shall
b.LUK.21.16	And yee shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren, and kinsefolkes and
b.LUK.21.17	And ye shalbe hated of all men for my Names sake.
b.LUK.21.18	But there shall not a haire of your head perish.
b.LUK.21.19	In your patience possesse ye your soules.
b.LUK.2.12	And this shall be a signe vnto you; yee shall find the babe wrapped in
b.LUK.21.2	And hee saw also a certaine poore widow, casting in thither two mites.
b.LUK.21.20	And when yee shall see Hierusalem compassed with armies, then know that the
b.LUK.21.21	Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines, and let them which
b.LUK.21.22	For these be the dayes of vengeance, that all things which are written may be
b.LUK.21.23	But woe vnto them that are with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those
b.LUK.21.24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall bee led away captiue
b.LUK.21.25	And there shalbe signes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Starres,
b.LUK.21.26	Mens hearts failing them for feare, and for looking after those things which
b.LUK.21.27	And then shall they see the sonne of man comming in a cloud with power and
b.LUK.21.28	And when these things begin to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your
b.LUK.21.29	And he spake to them a parable, Behold the figge tree, and all the trees,
b.LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heauenly hoste

b.LUK.21.32	Uerily I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe away, till all be
b.LUK.21.33	Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my words shall not passe away.
b.LUK.21.34	And take heed to your selues, least at any time your hearts be ouercharged

b.LUK.21.4	For all these haue of their abundance cast in vnto the offerings of God, but
b.LUK.2.15	And it came to passe, as the Angels were gone away from them into heauen, the
b.LUK.21.5	And as some spake of the Temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones, and
b.LUK.2.16	And they came with haste, and found Mary and Ioseph, and the babe lying in a

b.LUK.2.17	And when they had seene it, they made knowen abroad the saying, which was
b.LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what
b.LUK.2.18	And all they that heard it, wondered at those things, which were tolde them
b.LUK.21.8	And he said, Take heede that yee be not deceiued: for many shall come in my
b.LUK.2.19	But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
b.LUK.21.9	But when ye shall heare of wars, and commotions, be not terrified: for these
b.LUK.2.2	(And this taxing was first made whe Cyrenius was gouernor of
b.LUK.2.20	And the shepheards returned, glorifying &amp; praising God for all the things
b.LUK.2.21	And when eight dayes were accomplished for the circumcising of the childe,
b.LUK.22.1	Now ye feast of vnleuened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passeouer.
b.LUK.22.10	And he said vnto them, Behold, when ye are entred into the citie, there shall
b.LUK.22.11	And yee shall say vnto the goodman of the house, The Master saith vnto thee,
b.LUK.22.12	And he shall shew you a large vpper roume furnished, there make ready.
b.LUK.22.13	And they went, and found as hee had said vnto them, and they made readie the
b.LUK.22.14	And when the houre was come, he sate downe, and the twelue Apostles with him.
b.LUK.22.15	And he said vnto them, With desire I haue desired to eate this Passeouer with
b.LUK.22.16	For I say vnto you, I will not any more eate thereof, vntill it be fulfilled
b.LUK.22.17	And hee tooke the cup, and gaue thanks, and said, Take this, and diuide it
b.LUK.22.18	For I say vnto you, I will not drinke of the fruit of the Uine, vntill the
b.LUK.22.19	And hee tooke bread, and gaue thankes, and brake it, and gaue vnto them,
b.LUK.2.22	And when the dayes of her purification according to the law of Moses, were
b.LUK.22.2	And the chiefe Priests and Scribes sought how they might kill him; for they
b.LUK.22.20	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Testament in
b.LUK.22.21	But beholde, the hand of him that betrayeth mee, is with mee on the table.
b.LUK.22.22	And truly the Sonne of man goeth as it was determined, but woe vnto that man
b.LUK.22.23	And they began to enquire among themselues, which of them it was that should
b.LUK.22.24	And there was also a strife among them, which of them should bee accompted
b.LUK.22.25	And hee saide vnto them, The Kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship ouer
b.LUK.22.26	But ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the
b.LUK.22.27	For whether is greater, hee that sitteth at meat, or hee that serueth? Is not

b.LUK.22.32	But I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not; and when thou art
b.LUK.22.33	And hee said vnto him, Lord, I am ready to goe with thee both into prison,
b.LUK.22.34	And hee said, I tell thee Peter, the cocke shall not crow this day, before
b.LUK.22.35	And he said vnto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shooes,
b.LUK.22.36	Then saide hee vnto them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and
b.LUK.22.37	For I say vnto you, that this that is written, must yet be accomplished in

b.LUK.22.39	And he came out, and went, as hee was wont, to the mount of Oliues, and his
b.LUK.2.24	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the
b.LUK.22.4	And he went his way, and communed with the chiefe Priests and captaines, how
b.LUK.22.40	And when he was at the place, he said vnto them, Pray, that yee enter not
b.LUK.22.41	And he was withdrawen from them about a stones cast, and kneeled downe, and
b.LUK.22.42	Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remooue this cup from me: neuerthelesse,
b.LUK.22.43	And there appeared an Angel vnto him from heauen, strengthening him.
b.LUK.22.44	And being in an agonie, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it
b.LUK.22.45	And when he rose vp from prayer, and was come to his disciples, hee found
b.LUK.22.46	And said vnto them, Why sleepe yee? Rise, and pray, lest yee enter into
b.LUK.22.47	And while he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and hee that was called Iudas,
b.LUK.22.48	But Iesus said vnto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the sonne of man with a kisse?
b.LUK.22.49	When they which were about him, saw what would follow, they said vnto him,
b.LUK.2.25	And behold, there was a man in Hierusalem, whose name was Simeon, and the
b.LUK.22.5	And they were glad, and couenanted to giue him money.
b.LUK.22.50	And one of them smote the seruant of the high Priest, and cut off his right
b.LUK.22.51	And Iesus answered, and said, Suffer ye thus farre. And he touched his eare,
b.LUK.22.52	Then Iesus said vnto the chiefe Priests, and captaines of the
b.LUK.22.53	When I was daily with you in the
b.LUK.22.54	Then tooke they him, and led him, and brought him into the high Priests
b.LUK.22.55	And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall, and were set
b.LUK.22.56	But a certaine maide beheld him as he sate by the fire, and earnestly looked
b.LUK.22.57	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
b.LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him, &amp; said, Thou art also of them.
b.LUK.22.59	And about the space of one houre after, another confidently affirmed, saying,
b.LUK.2.26	And it was reuealed vnto him by the holy Ghost, that he should not see death,
b.LUK.22.6	And he promised, and sought opportunitie to betray him vnto them in the
b.LUK.22.60	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately while he
b.LUK.22.61	And the Lord turned, and looked vpon Peter; and Peter remembred the word of
b.LUK.22.62	And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
b.LUK.22.63	And the men that helde Iesus, mocked him, and smote him.
b.LUK.22.64	And when they had blindfolded him, they stroke him on the face, and asked
b.LUK.22.65	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
b.LUK.22.66	And assoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, &amp; the chiefe Priests
b.LUK.22.67	Art thou the Christ? Tell vs. And hee said vnto them, If I tell you, you will
b.LUK.22.68	And if I also aske you, you will not answere me, nor let me goe.
b.LUK.22.69	Hereafter shal the sonne of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
b.LUK.2.27	And hee came by the spirit into the
b.LUK.22.7	Then came the day of vnleauened bread, when the Passeouer must be killed.
b.LUK.22.70	Then said they all, Art thou then the Sonne of God? And hee said vnto them,
b.LUK.22.71	And they said, What need we any further witnesse? For wee our selues haue
b.LUK.2.28	Then tooke hee him vp in his armes, and blessed God, and said,
b.LUK.22.8	And he sent Peter and Iohn, saying, Goe and prepare vs the Passeouer, that we
b.LUK.2.29	Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, according to thy word.
b.LUK.22.9	And they said vnto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
b.LUK.2.3	And all went to bee taxed, euery one into his owne citie.
b.LUK.2.30	For mine eyes haue seene thy saluation.
b.LUK.2.31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.
b.LUK.23.1	And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him vnto Pilate.
b.LUK.23.10	And the chiefe Priests and Scribes stood, and vehemently accused him.
b.LUK.23.11	And Herod with his men of warre set him at naught, and mocked him, and arayed
b.LUK.23.12	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before,
b.LUK.23.13	And Pilate, when hee had called together the chiefe Priests, and the rulers,
b.LUK.23.14	Said vnto them, Ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerteth the
b.LUK.23.15	No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him, and loe, nothing worthy of death is
b.LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
b.LUK.23.17	For of necessitie hee must release one vnto them at the Feast.
b.LUK.23.18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release vnto
b.LUK.23.19	Who for a certaine sedition made in the citie, and for murder, was cast in
b.LUK.2.32	A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
b.LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow peruerting the
b.LUK.23.20	Pilate therefore willing to release Iesus, spake againe to them:
b.LUK.23.21	But they cried, saying, Crucifie him, crucifie him.
b.LUK.23.22	And hee said vnto them the third time, Why, what euill hath he done? I haue
b.LUK.23.23	And they were instant with loud voyces, requiring that he might be crucified:
b.LUK.23.24	And Pilate gaue sentence that it should be as they required.
b.LUK.23.25	And he released vnto them, him that for sedition and murder was cast into
b.LUK.23.26	And as they led him away, they laid hold vpon one Simon a Cyrenian, comming
b.LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also
b.LUK.23.28	But Iesus turning vnto them, said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe not for me,
b.LUK.23.29	For beholde, the dayes are comming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are
b.LUK.2.33	And Ioseph and his mother marueiled at those things which were spoken of him.
b.LUK.23.3	And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Iewes? And he answered
b.LUK.23.30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, Fall on vs, and to the hils,
b.LUK.23.31	For if they doe these things in a green tree, what shalbe done in the drie?
b.LUK.23.32	And there were also two other malefactors led with him, to bee put to death.
b.LUK.23.33	And when they were come to the place which is called Caluarie, there they
b.LUK.23.34	Then said Iesus, Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they doe: And
b.LUK.23.35	And the people stood beholding, &amp; the rulers also with them derided him,
b.LUK.23.36	And the souldiers also mocked him, comming to him, and offering him vineger,
b.LUK.23.37	And saying, If thou be the king of the Iewes, saue thy selfe.
b.LUK.23.38	And a superscription also was written ouer him in letters of Greeke, and
b.LUK.23.39	And one of ye malefactors, which were hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou
b.LUK.2.34	And Simeon blessed them, and said vnto Marie his mother, Behold, this child
b.LUK.23.4	Then saide Pilate to the chiefe Priests, and to the people, I finde no fault
b.LUK.23.40	But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Doest not thou feare God,
b.LUK.23.41	And we indeed iustly; for we receiue the due reward of our deeds, but this
b.LUK.23.42	And he said vnto Iesus, Lord, remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome.
b.LUK.23.43	And Iesus said vnto him, Uerily, I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with
b.LUK.23.44	And it was about the sixt houre, and there was a darkenesse ouer all the
b.LUK.23.45	And the Sunne was darkened, and the vaile of the temple was rent in the mids.
b.LUK.23.46	And when Iesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I
b.LUK.23.47	Now when the Centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly
b.LUK.23.48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things
b.LUK.23.49	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
b.LUK.2.35	(Yea a sword shall pearce thorow thy owne soule also) that the thoughts of
b.LUK.23.5	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth vp the people, teaching
b.LUK.23.50	And behold, there was a man named Ioseph, a counseller, and hee was a good
b.LUK.23.51	(The same had not consented to the counsell and deede of them) he was of
b.LUK.23.52	This man went vnto Pilate, and begged the body of Iesus.
b.LUK.23.53	And he tooke it downe, and wrapped it in linnen, and layd it in a Sepulchre
b.LUK.23.54	And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.
b.LUK.23.55	And the women also which came with him from
b.LUK.23.56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath
b.LUK.2.36	And there was one Anna a Prophetesse, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe
b.LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard of
b.LUK.2.37	And she was a widow of about fourescore and foure yeeres, which departed not
b.LUK.23.7	And assoone as he knew that hee belonged vnto Herods iurisdiction, hee sent
b.LUK.2.38	And she comming in that instant, gaue thankes likewise vnto the Lord, and
b.LUK.23.8	And when Herode saw Iesus, he was exceeding glad, for hee was desirous to see
b.LUK.2.39	And when they had performed all things according to the Lawe of the Lord,
b.LUK.23.9	Then he questioned with him in many words, but he answered him nothing.
b.LUK.2.4	And Ioseph also wet vp fro Galilee, out of the citie of
b.LUK.2.40	And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisedome, and the
b.LUK.2.41	Now his parents went to Hierusalem euery yeere, at the feast of the Passeouer.
b.LUK.24.1	Now vpon the first day of the weeke, very earely in the morning, they came
b.LUK.24.10	It was Marie Magdalene, &amp; Ioanna, &amp; Mary the mother of Iames, and
b.LUK.24.11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they beleeued them not.
b.LUK.24.12	Then arose Peter, and ranne vnto the Sepulchre, and stowping downe, hee
b.LUK.24.13	And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emaus, which
b.LUK.24.14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
b.LUK.24.15	And it came to passe, that while they communed together, and reasoned, Iesus
b.LUK.24.16	But their eyes were holden, that they should not know him.
b.LUK.24.17	And he said vnto them, What maner of communications are these that yee haue
b.LUK.24.18	And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, saide vnto him, Art
b.LUK.24.19	And hee saide vnto them, What things? And they said vnto him, Concerning
b.LUK.2.42	And when he was twelue yeeres old, they went vp to Hierusalem, after the
b.LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the Sepulchre.
b.LUK.24.20	And how the chiefe Priests and our rulers deliuered him to be condemned to
b.LUK.24.21	But wee trusted that it had bene hee, which should haue redeemed
b.LUK.24.22	Yea, and certaine women also of our company made vs astonished, which were
b.LUK.24.23	And when they found not his bodie, they came, saying, that they had also
b.LUK.24.24	And certaine of them which were with vs, went to the Sepulchre, and found it
b.LUK.24.25	Then hee saide vnto them, O fooles, and slow of heart to beleeue all that the
b.LUK.24.26	Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glorie?
b.LUK.24.27	And beginning at Moses, and all the Prophets, hee expounded vnto them in all
b.LUK.24.28	And they drew nigh vnto the village, whither they went, and hee made as
b.LUK.24.29	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with vs, for it is towards euening,
b.LUK.2.43	And when they had fulfilled the dayes, as they returned, the childe Iesus
b.LUK.24.3	And they entred in, and found not the body of the Lord Iesus.
b.LUK.24.30	And it came to passe, as hee sate at meate with them, hee tooke bread, and
b.LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their
b.LUK.24.32	And they said one vnto another, Did not our heart burne within vs, while hee
b.LUK.24.33	And they rose vp the same houre, and returned to Hierusalem, and found the
b.LUK.24.34	Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
b.LUK.24.35	And they told what things were done in the way, &amp; how he was knowen of
b.LUK.24.36	And as they thus spake, Iesus himselfe stood in the midst of them, and sayeth
b.LUK.24.37	But they were terrified, and afrighted, and supposed that they had seene a
b.LUK.24.38	And he said vnto them, Why are yee troubled, and why doe thoughts arise in
b.LUK.24.39	Beholde my hands and my feete, that it is I my selfe: handle me, and see, for
b.LUK.2.44	But they supposing him to haue bene in the company, went a daies iourney, and
b.LUK.24.4	And it came to passe, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men
b.LUK.24.40	And when hee had thus spoken, hee shewed them his handes and his feete.
b.LUK.24.41	And while they yet beleeued not for ioy, and wondered, hee saide vnto them,
b.LUK.24.42	And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an hony combe.
b.LUK.24.43	And he tooke it, and did eate before them.
b.LUK.24.44	And hee said vnto them, These are the words which I spake vnto you, while I
b.LUK.24.45	Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the
b.LUK.24.46	And said vnto them, Thus it is written, &amp; thus it behoued Christ to
b.LUK.24.47	And that repentance and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name,
b.LUK.24.48	And yee are witnesses of these things.
b.LUK.24.49	And behold, I send the promise of my Father vpon you: but tarie ye in the
b.LUK.2.45	And when they found him not, they turned backe againe to Hierusalem, seeking
b.LUK.24.5	And as they were afraid, and bowed downe their faces to the earth, they said
b.LUK.24.50	And he led them out as farre as to Bethanie, and hee lift vp his hands, and
b.LUK.24.51	And it came to passe, while hee blessed them, hee was parted from them, and
b.LUK.24.52	And they worshipped him, and returned to Hierusalem, with great ioy:
b.LUK.24.53	And were continually in the
b.LUK.2.46	And it came to passe, that after three daies they found him in the
b.LUK.24.6	He is not heere, but is risen: Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet
b.LUK.2.47	And all that heard him were astonished at his vnderstanding, and answeres.
b.LUK.24.7	Saying, The Sonne of man must be deliuered into the hands of sinfull men, and
b.LUK.2.48	And when they sawe him, they were amazed: and his mother said vnto him, Sonne,
b.LUK.24.8	And they remembred his words,
b.LUK.2.49	And he said vnto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist yee not that I must
b.LUK.24.9	And returned from the Sepulchre, and told all these things vnto the eleuen,
b.LUK.2.5	To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
b.LUK.2.50	And they vnderstood not the saying which he spake vnto them.
b.LUK.2.51	And he went downe with them, and came to
b.LUK.2.52	And Iesus increased in wisedom and stature, and in fauour with God and man.
b.LUK.2.6	And so it was, that while they were there, the dayes were accomplished that
b.LUK.2.7	And she brought foorth her first borne sonne, and wrapped him in swadling
b.LUK.2.8	And there were in the same countrey shepheards abiding in ye field, keeping
b.LUK.2.9	And loe, the Angel of the Lord came vpon them, and the glory of the Lord shone
b.LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate
b.LUK.3.10	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we doe then?
b.LUK.3.11	He answereth, and saith vnto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to
b.LUK.3.12	Then came also Publicanes to be baptized, and said vnto him, Master, what
b.LUK.3.13	And he said vnto them, Exact no more then that which is appointed you.
b.LUK.3.14	And the souldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we doe?
b.LUK.3.15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of
b.LUK.3.16	Iohn answered, saying vnto them all, I indeede baptize you with water, but
b.LUK.3.17	Whose fanne is in his hand, and he will thorowly purge his floore, and will
b.LUK.3.18	And many other things in his exhortation preached he vnto the people.
b.LUK.3.19	But Herode the Tetrarch being reprooued by him for Herodias his brother
b.LUK.3.2	Annas and Caiaphas being the high Priests, the word of God came vnto Iohn the
b.LUK.3.20	Added yet this aboue all, that he shut vp Iohn in prison.
b.LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, and it came to passe that Iesus also
b.LUK.3.22	And the holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a Doue vpon him, and a

b.LUK.3.36	Which was the sonne of Cainan, which was the sonne of Arphaxad, which was the
b.LUK.3.37	Which was the sonne of Mathusala, which was the sonne of Enoch, which was the
b.LUK.3.38	Which was the sonne of Enos, which was the sonne of Seth, which was the sonne
b.LUK.3.4	As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the Prophet, saying, The
b.LUK.3.5	Euery valley shall be filled, and euery mountaine and hill shalbe brought low,
b.LUK.3.6	And all flesh shal see the saluation of God.
b.LUK.3.7	Then said hee to the multitude that came forth to bee baptized of him, O
b.LUK.3.8	Bring forth therfore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within
b.LUK.3.9	And now also the axe is laid vnto the root of the trees: Euery tree therefore
b.LUK.4.1	And Iesus being full of the holy Ghost, returned from Iordane, and was led by
b.LUK.4.10	For it is written, He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee.
b.LUK.4.11	And in their handes they shall beare thee vp, lest at any time thou dash thy
b.LUK.4.12	And Iesus answering, said vnto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
b.LUK.4.13	And when the deuil had ended all the temptation, hee departed from him for a
b.LUK.4.14	And Iesus returned in the power of the Spirit into
b.LUK.4.15	And hee taught in their Synagogues, being glorified of all.
b.LUK.4.16	And hee came to
b.LUK.4.17	And there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Prophet Esaias, and when he
b.LUK.4.18	The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, because hee hath anointed mee, to preach
b.LUK.4.19	To preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord.
b.LUK.4.2	Being fourtie dayes tempted of the deuil, and in those dayes he did eat
b.LUK.4.20	And he closed the booke, and hee gaue it againe to the minister, and sate
b.LUK.4.21	And hee began to say vnto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your
b.LUK.4.22	And all bare him witnesse, and wondered at the gracious wordes, which
b.LUK.4.23	And hee said vnto them, Yee will surely say vnto me this prouerbe, Physition,
b.LUK.4.24	And hee said, Verely I say vnto you, no Prophet is accepted in his owne
b.LUK.4.25	But I tell you of a trueth, many widowes were in
b.LUK.4.26	But vnto none of them was Elias sent, saue vnto Sarepta a citie of
b.LUK.4.27	And many lepers were in
b.LUK.4.28	And all they in the Synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with
b.LUK.4.29	And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, &amp; led him vnto the brow of
b.LUK.4.3	And the deuil saide vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, command this stone
b.LUK.4.30	But he passing thorow the mids of them, went his way:
b.LUK.4.31	And came downe to
b.LUK.4.32	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his worde was with power.
b.LUK.4.33	And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill,
b.LUK.4.34	Saying, Let vs alone, what haue wee to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth?
b.LUK.4.35	And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. And when
b.LUK.4.36	And they were all amazed, and spake among themselues, saying, What a word is
b.LUK.4.37	And the fame of him went out into euery place of the countrey round about.
b.LUK.4.38	And he arose out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons house: and Simons
b.LUK.4.39	And he stood ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, &amp; it left her. And
b.LUK.4.4	And Iesus answered him, saying, It is written, that man shall not liue by
b.LUK.4.40	Now when the Sunne was setting, all they that had any sicke with diuers
b.LUK.4.41	And deuils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the
b.LUK.4.42	And when it was day, he departed, and went into a desert place: and the
b.LUK.4.43	And hee said vnto them, I must preach the kingdome of God to other cities
b.LUK.4.44	And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile.
b.LUK.4.5	And the deuil taking him vp into an high mountaine, shewed vnto him all the
b.LUK.4.6	And the deuil said vnto him, All this power will I giue thee, and the glory of
b.LUK.4.7	If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shalbe thine.
b.LUK.4.8	And Iesus answered and said vnto him, Get thee behinde me, Satan: for it is
b.LUK.4.9	And hee brought him to Hierusalem, and set him on a pinacle of the
b.LUK.5.1	And it came to passe, that as the people preassed vpon him to heare the word
b.LUK.5.10	And so was also Iames, and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee, which were partners
b.LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsooke all, and
b.LUK.5.12	And it came to passe, when he was in a certaine citie, behold a man full of
b.LUK.5.13	And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I wil: be thou cleane.
b.LUK.5.14	And hee charged him to tell no man: but, Goe, and shewe thy selfe to the
b.LUK.5.15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes
b.LUK.5.16	And he withdrew himselfe into the wildernesse, and prayed.
b.LUK.5.17	And it came to passe on a certaine day, as hee was teaching, that there were
b.LUK.5.18	And behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsie: and
b.LUK.5.19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of
b.LUK.5.2	And sawe two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of
b.LUK.5.20	And when he saw their faith, hee said vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen
b.LUK.5.21	And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which
b.LUK.5.22	But when Iesus perceiued their thoughts, he answering, saide vnto them, What
b.LUK.5.23	Whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Rise vp and
b.LUK.5.24	But that ye may know that the Sonne of man hath power vpon earth to forgiue
b.LUK.5.25	And immediatly he rose vp before them, and tooke vp that whereon hee lay, and
b.LUK.5.26	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with feare,
b.LUK.5.27	And after these things hee went foorth, and sawe a Publicane, named Leui,
b.LUK.5.28	And he left all, rose vp, and followed him.
b.LUK.5.29	And Leui made him a great feast in his owne house: and there was a great
b.LUK.5.3	And he entred into one of the ships, which was Simons, and prayed him, that he
b.LUK.5.30	But their Scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why
b.LUK.5.31	And Iesus answering, said vnto them, They that are whole need not a
b.LUK.5.32	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
b.LUK.5.33	And they said vnto him, Why doe the disciples of Iohn fast often, and make
b.LUK.5.34	And he said vnto them, Can yee make the children of the Bride-chamber fast,
b.LUK.5.35	But the dayes will come, when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them,
b.LUK.5.36	And he spake also a parable vnto them, No man putteth a piece of a newe
b.LUK.5.37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine will burst
b.LUK.5.38	But newe wine must be put into newe bottles, and both are preserued.
b.LUK.5.39	No man also hauing drunke olde wine, straightway desireth new: for he saith,
b.LUK.5.4	Now when he had left speaking, he said vnto Simon, Lanch out into the deepe,
b.LUK.5.5	And Simon answering, said vnto him, Master, wee haue toiled all the night, and
b.LUK.5.6	And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and
b.LUK.5.7	And they beckened vnto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they
b.LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw it, he fell downe at Iesus knees, saying, Depart from me,
b.LUK.5.9	For he was astonished, and al that were with him, at the draught of the fishes
b.LUK.6.1	And it came to passe on the second Sabbath after the first, that he went
b.LUK.6.10	And looking round about vpon them all, he said vnto the man, Stretch foorth
b.LUK.6.11	And they were filled with madnesse, and communed one with another what they
b.LUK.6.12	And it came to passe in those dayes, that hee went out into a mountaine to
b.LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called vnto him his disciples: and of them he chose
b.LUK.6.14	Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother: Iames and Iohn,
b.LUK.6.15	Matthew and Thomas, Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon, called Zelotes,
b.LUK.6.16	And Iudas the brother of Iames, and Iudas Iscariot, which also was the
b.LUK.6.17	And hee came downe with them, and stood in the plaine, and the company of his
b.LUK.6.18	And they that were vexed with vncleane spirits: and they were healed.
b.LUK.6.19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went vertue out of
b.LUK.6.2	And certaine of the Pharisees said vnto them, Why doe yee that which is not
b.LUK.6.20	And hee lifted vp his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be yee poore:
b.LUK.6.21	Blessed are yee that hunger now: for yee shall be filled. Blessed are yee
b.LUK.6.22	Blessed are yee when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you
b.LUK.6.23	Reioice yee in that day, and leape for ioy: for behold, your reward is great
b.LUK.6.24	But woe vnto you that are rich: for yee haue receiued your consolation.
b.LUK.6.25	Woe vnto you that are full: for yee shall hunger. Woe vnto you that laugh
b.LUK.6.26	Woe vnto you when all men shall speake well of you: for so did their fathers
b.LUK.6.27	But I say vnto you which heare, Loue your enemies, doe good to them which
b.LUK.6.28	Blesse them that curse you, &amp; pray for them which despitefully vse you.
b.LUK.6.29	And vnto him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke, offer also the other: and
b.LUK.6.3	And Iesus answering them, said, Haue yee not read so much as this what Dauid
b.LUK.6.30	Giue to euery man that asketh of thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods,
b.LUK.6.31	And as yee would that men should doe to you, doe yee also to them likewise.
b.LUK.6.32	For if yee loue them which loue you, what thanke haue ye? for sinners also
b.LUK.6.33	And if ye doe good to them which doe good to you, What thanke haue ye? for
b.LUK.6.34	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiue, What thanke haue ye? for
b.LUK.6.35	But loue yee your enemies, and doe good, and lend, hoping for nothing againe:
b.LUK.6.36	Be ye therefore mercifull, as your Father also is mercifull.
b.LUK.6.37	Iudge not, and ye shall not bee iudged: condemne not, and ye shall not be
b.LUK.6.38	Giue, and it shall bee giuen vnto you, good measure, preassed downe, and
b.LUK.6.39	And hee spake a parable vnto them, Can the blinde leade the blinde? Shall
b.LUK.6.4	How he went into the house of God, and did take and eate the Shew bread, and
b.LUK.6.40	The disciple is not aboue his master: but euery one that is perfect shalbe as
b.LUK.6.41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but perceiuest
b.LUK.6.42	Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let mee pull out the mote
b.LUK.6.43	For a good tree bringeth not foorth corrupt fruit: neither doeth a corrupt
b.LUK.6.44	For euery tree is knowen by his owne fruit: for of thornes men doe not gather
b.LUK.6.45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth foorth that which
b.LUK.6.46	And why call ye mee Lord, Lord, and doe not the things which I say?
b.LUK.6.47	Whosoeuer commeth to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew
b.LUK.6.48	He is like a man which built an house, and digged deepe, and layd the
b.LUK.6.49	But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation
b.LUK.6.5	And he said vnto them, That the sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.
b.LUK.6.6	And it came to passe also on another Sabbath, that he entred into the
b.LUK.6.7	And the Scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heale on the
b.LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand,
b.LUK.6.9	Then said Iesus vnto them, I will aske you one thing, Is it lawfull on the
b.LUK.7.1	Now when hee had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, hee
b.LUK.7.10	And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the seruant whole that
b.LUK.7.11	And it came to passe the day after, that he went into a citie called Naim:
b.LUK.7.12	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the citie, behold, there was a dead man
b.LUK.7.13	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and saide vnto her,
b.LUK.7.14	And hee came and touched the beere (and they that bare him, stood still.) And
b.LUK.7.15	And he that was dead, sate vp, and began to speake: and he deliuered him to
b.LUK.7.16	And there came a feare on all, and they glorified God, saying, that a great
b.LUK.7.17	And this rumour of him went foorth throughout all Iudea, and throughout all
b.LUK.7.18	And the disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these things.
b.LUK.7.19	And Iohn calling vnto him two of his disciples, sent them to Iesus, saying,
b.LUK.7.2	And a certaine Centurions seruant, who was deare vnto him, was sicke and ready
b.LUK.7.20	When the men were come vnto him, they said, Iohn Baptist hath sent vs vnto
b.LUK.7.21	And in that same houre hee cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and
b.LUK.7.22	Then Iesus answering, said vnto them, Go your way, and tell Iohn what things
b.LUK.7.23	And blessed is he whosoeuer shall not be offended in me.
b.LUK.7.24	And when the messengers of Iohn were departed, hee beganne to speake vnto ye
b.LUK.7.25	But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they
b.LUK.7.26	But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say vnto you, and much
b.LUK.7.27	This is he of whome it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy
b.LUK.7.28	For I say vnto you, among those that are borne of women, there is not a
b.LUK.7.29	And all the people that heard him, and the Publicanes, iustified God, being
b.LUK.7.3	And when he heard of Iesus, he sent vnto him the Elders of the Iewes,
b.LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and Lawyers reiected the counsell of God against themselues,
b.LUK.7.31	And the Lord said, whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation?
b.LUK.7.32	They are like vnto children sitting in the market place, &amp; calling one to
b.LUK.7.33	For Iohn the Baptist came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye
b.LUK.7.34	The sonne of man is come, eating, and drinking, and ye say, Behold a
b.LUK.7.35	But wisedome is iustified of all her children.
b.LUK.7.36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went
b.LUK.7.37	And behold, a woman in the citie which was a sinner, when shee knew that
b.LUK.7.38	And stood at his feet behind him, weeping, and began to wash his feete with
b.LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him, saw it, he spake within himselfe,
b.LUK.7.4	And when they came to Iesus, they besought him instantly, saying, that hee was
b.LUK.7.40	And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Simon, I haue somewhat to say vnto thee.
b.LUK.7.41	There was a certaine creditour, which had two debtors: the one ought fiue
b.LUK.7.42	And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgaue them both. Tell me
b.LUK.7.43	Simon answered, and saide, I suppose, that hee to whome he forgaue most. And
b.LUK.7.44	And hee turned to the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I
b.LUK.7.45	Thou gauest me no kisse: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not
b.LUK.7.46	Mine head with oile thou didst not anoint: but this woman anointed my feet
b.LUK.7.47	Wherefore, I say vnto thee, her sinnes, which are many, are forgiuen, for she
b.LUK.7.48	And he said vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen.
b.LUK.7.49	And they that sate at meat with him, began to say within themselues, Who is
b.LUK.7.5	For he loueth our nation, and hee hath built vs a Synagogue.
b.LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saued thee, goe in peace.
b.LUK.7.6	Then Iesus went with them. And when he was now not farre from the house, the
b.LUK.7.7	Wherefore neither thought I my selfe worthy to come vnto thee: but say in a
b.LUK.7.8	For I also am a man set vnder authoritie, hauing vnder mee souldiers: and I
b.LUK.7.9	When Iesus heard these things, hee marueiled at him, and turned him about, and
b.LUK.8.1	And it came to passe afterward, that he went throughout euery citie and
b.LUK.8.10	And he said, Unto you it is giuen to know the mysteries of the kingdome of
b.LUK.8.11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
b.LUK.8.12	Those by the way side, are they that heare: then commeth the deuil, and
b.LUK.8.13	They on the rocke, are they which when they heare, receiue the word with ioy;
b.LUK.8.14	And that which fell among thornes, are they, which when they haue heard, goe
b.LUK.8.15	But that on the good ground, are they, which in an honest and good heart
b.LUK.8.16	No man when he hath lighted a candle, couereth it with a vessell, or putteth
b.LUK.8.17	For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest: neither any thing
b.LUK.8.18	Take heede therefore how yee heare: for whosoeuer hath, to him shall bee
b.LUK.8.19	Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for
b.LUK.8.2	And certaine women which had bene healed of euill spirits and infirmities,
b.LUK.8.20	And it was told him by certaine which saide, Thy mother and thy brethren
b.LUK.8.21	And hee answered and said vnto them, My mother and my brethren are these
b.LUK.8.22	Now it came to passe on a certaine day, that he went into a ship, with his
b.LUK.8.23	But as they sailed, he fell asleepe, and there came downe a storme of wind on
b.LUK.8.24	And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then
b.LUK.8.25	And he saide vnto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraide wondred,
b.LUK.8.26	And they arriued at the countrey of the Gadarenes, which is ouer against
b.LUK.8.27	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the citie a certaine man
b.LUK.8.28	When he saw Iesus, he cried out, and fell downe before him, and with a loud
b.LUK.8.29	(For he had commanded the vncleane spirit to come out of the man: For
b.LUK.8.3	And Ioanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna, and many others
b.LUK.8.30	And Iesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because
b.LUK.8.31	And they besought him, that he would not command them to goe out into the
b.LUK.8.32	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountaine: and they
b.LUK.8.33	Then went the deuils out of the man, and entred into the swine: and the herd
b.LUK.8.34	When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went, and tolde it
b.LUK.8.35	Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Iesus, and found the
b.LUK.8.36	They also which saw it, told them by what meanes he that was possessed of the
b.LUK.8.37	Then the whole multitude of the countrey of the Gadarenes round about,
b.LUK.8.38	Now the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, besought him that he might
b.LUK.8.39	Returne to thine owne house, and shew how great things God hath done vnto
b.LUK.8.4	And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of euery
b.LUK.8.40	And it came to passe, that when Iesus was returned, the people gladly
b.LUK.8.41	And behold, there came a man named Iairus, and hee was a ruler of the
b.LUK.8.42	For hee had one onely daughter about twelue yeeres of age, and she lay a
b.LUK.8.43	And a woman hauing an issue of blood twelue yeres, which had spent all her
b.LUK.8.44	Came behinde him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediatly her
b.LUK.8.45	And Iesus saide, Who touched mee? When all denied, Peter and they that were
b.LUK.8.46	And Iesus saide, Some body hath touched mee: for I perceiue that vertue is
b.LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, shee came trembling, and falling
b.LUK.8.48	And he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee
b.LUK.8.49	While hee yet spake, there commeth one from the ruler of the Synagogues
b.LUK.8.5	A Sower went out to sowe his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayes
b.LUK.8.50	But when Iesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Feare not, beleeue onely,
b.LUK.8.51	And when hee came into the house, hee suffered no man to goe in, saue Peter,
b.LUK.8.52	And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weepe not, she is not dead, but
b.LUK.8.53	And they laughed him to scorne, knowing that she was dead.
b.LUK.8.54	And hee put them all out, and tooke her by the hand, and called, saying, Mayd,
b.LUK.8.55	And her spirit came againe, and shee arose straightway: and hee commanded to
b.LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished: but hee charged them that they should tell
b.LUK.8.6	And some fell vpon a rocke, and assoone as it was sprung vp, it withered away,
b.LUK.8.7	And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprang vp with it, and choked it.
b.LUK.8.8	And other fell on good ground, and sprang vp, and bare fruite an hundred fold.
b.LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
b.LUK.9.1	Then he called his twelue disciples together, and gaue them power and
b.LUK.9.10	And the Apostles when they were returned, tolde him all that they had done.
b.LUK.9.11	And the people when they knew it, followed him, and he receiued them, and
b.LUK.9.12	And when the day beganne to weare away, then came the twelue, and said vnto
b.LUK.9.13	But he said vnto them, Giue yee them to eate. And they said, Wee haue no more
b.LUK.9.14	For they were about fiue thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make
b.LUK.9.15	And they did so, and made them all sit downe.
b.LUK.9.16	Then he tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looking vp to heauen,
b.LUK.9.17	And they did eate, and were all filled. And there was taken vp of fragments
b.LUK.9.18	And it came to passe, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him:
b.LUK.9.19	They answering, said, Iohn the Baptist: but some say, Elias: and others say,
b.LUK.9.2	And hee sent them to preach the Kingdome of God, and to heale the sicke.
b.LUK.9.20	He said vnto them, But whom say yee that I am? Peter answering, said, The
b.LUK.9.21	And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing,
b.LUK.9.22	Saying, The Sonne of man must suffer many things, and be reiected of the
b.LUK.9.23	And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him denie
b.LUK.9.24	For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: but whosoeuer will lose his
b.LUK.9.25	For what is a man aduantaged, if hee gaine the whole world, and lose himselfe,
b.LUK.9.26	For whosoeuer shall bee ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of him shall the
b.LUK.9.27	But I tell you of a trueth, there be some standing here, which shall not
b.LUK.9.28	And it came to passe, about an eight dayes after these sayings, hee tooke
b.LUK.9.29	And as hee prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his
b.LUK.9.3	And he said vnto them, Take nothing for your iourney, neither staues, nor
b.LUK.9.30	And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias,
b.LUK.9.31	Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease, which he should accomplish
b.LUK.9.32	But Peter, and they that were with him, were heauie with sleepe: and when
b.LUK.9.33	And it came to passe, as they departed from him, Peter said vnto Iesus,
b.LUK.9.34	While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and ouershadowed them, &amp; they
b.LUK.9.35	And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloued Son,
b.LUK.9.36	And when the voyce was past, Iesus was found alone, and they kept it close,
b.LUK.9.37	And it came to passe, that on the next day, when they were come downe from
b.LUK.9.38	And behold, a man of the companie cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee
b.LUK.9.39	And loe, a spirit taketh him, and hee suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him
b.LUK.9.4	And whatsoeuer house yee enter into, there abide, and thence depart.
b.LUK.9.40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
b.LUK.9.41	And Iesus answering, said, O faithlesse, and peruerse generation, how long
b.LUK.9.42	And as he was yet a comming, the deuill threw him downe, and tare him: and
b.LUK.9.43	And they were al amazed at the mightie power of God: But while they wondred
b.LUK.9.44	Let these sayings sinke downe into your eares: for the Sonne of man shall bee
b.LUK.9.45	But they vnderstood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they
b.LUK.9.46	Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
b.LUK.9.47	And Iesus perceiuing ye thought of their heart, tooke a child, and set him by
b.LUK.9.48	And said vnto them, Whosoeuer shall receiue this child in my Name, receiueth
b.LUK.9.49	And Iohn answered, and said, Master, we saw one casting out deuils in thy
b.LUK.9.5	And whosoeuer will not receiue you, when ye goe out of that city, shake off
b.LUK.9.50	And Iesus said vnto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against vs, is
b.LUK.9.51	And it came to passe, when the time was come that he should bee receiued vp,
b.LUK.9.52	And sent messengers before his face, and they went and entred into a village
b.LUK.9.53	And they did not receiue him, because his face was as though he would goe to
b.LUK.9.54	And when his disciples, Iames and Iohn sawe this, they said, Lord, wilt thou
b.LUK.9.55	But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what maner spirit ye
b.LUK.9.56	For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them. And
b.LUK.9.57	And it came to passe that as they went in the way, a certaine man said vnto
b.LUK.9.58	And Iesus said vnto him, Foxes haue holes, and birds of the aire haue nests,
b.LUK.9.59	And he said vnto another, Follow me: But he said, Lord, suffer mee first to
b.LUK.9.6	And they departed, and went through the townes, preaching the Gospel, and
b.LUK.9.60	Iesus said vnto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the
b.LUK.9.61	And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee: but let me first goe bid
b.LUK.9.62	And Iesus said vnto him, No man hauing put his hand to the plough, and
b.LUK.9.7	Now Herode the Tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and hee was
b.LUK.9.8	And of some, that Elias had appeared: and of others, that one of the olde
b.LUK.9.9	And Herode said, Iohn haue I beheaded: but who is this of whom I heare such
b.MAL.1.1	The burden of the word of ye Lord to Israel by Malachi.
b.MAL.1.10	Who is there euen among you that would shut the doores for nought? neither

b.MAL.1.3	And I hated Esau, and layde his mountaines, and his heritage waste, for the
b.MAL.1.4	Whereas Edom sayth, Wee are impouerished, but we will returne and build the

b.MAL.1.6	A sonne honoureth his father, and a seruant his Master. If then I be a father,
b.MAL.1.7	Yee offer polluted bread vpon mine altar; and yee say, Wherein haue we

b.MAL.2.10	Haue we not all one father? hath not one God created vs? Why doe we deale
b.MAL.2.11	Iudah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and
b.MAL.2.12	The Lord will cut off the man that doth this: the Master and the scholler out
b.MAL.2.13	And this haue yee done againe, couering the Altar of the Lord with teares,
b.MAL.2.14	Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord hath bene witnes betweene thee and
b.MAL.2.15	And did not he make one? yet had he the residue of the spirit: and wherefore
b.MAL.2.16	For the Lord the God of Israel saith, that he hateth putting away: for one
b.MAL.2.17	Ye haue wearied the Lord with your words: yet ye say, Wherein haue we wearied
b.MAL.2.2	If ye will not heare, and if yee will not lay it to heart, to giue glory vnto
b.MAL.2.3	Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread doung vpon your faces, euen the

b.MAL.2.5	My couenant was with him of life and peace, and I gaue them to him, for the
b.MAL.2.6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquitie was not found in his lips: he
b.MAL.2.7	For the priests lips should keepe knowledge, and they should seeke the law at
b.MAL.2.8	But yee are departed out of the way: ye haue caused many to stumble at the
b.MAL.2.9	Therefore haue I also made you contemptible and base before al the people,
b.MAL.3.1	Beholde, I will send my messenger, and he shal prepare the way before mee: and
b.MAL.3.10	Bring ye all the tithes into the store-house, that there may be meate in mine
b.MAL.3.11	And I wil rebuke the deuourer for your sakes: and he shal not destroy the
b.MAL.3.12	And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land,
b.MAL.3.13	Your words haue bin stout against me, saith the Lord, yet ye say, What haue
b.MAL.3.14	Ye haue said, It is vaine to serue God: and what profit is it, that we haue
b.MAL.3.15	And now we call the proud happy: yea, they that worke wickednes are set vp,
b.MAL.3.16	Then they that feared the Lord, spake often one to another, and the Lord
b.MAL.3.17	And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make vp
b.MAL.3.18	Then shall yee returne and discerne betweene the righteous and the wicked,
b.MAL.3.2	But who may abide the day of his comming? and who shall stand when he
b.MAL.3.3	And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of siluer: and he shall purifie the
b.MAL.3.4	Then shall the offerings of Iudah and Ierusalem bee pleasant vnto the Lord, as
b.MAL.3.5	And I will come neere to you to iudgement, and I will bee a swift witnesse
b.MAL.3.6	For I am the Lord, I change not: therefore ye sonnes of Iacob are not
b.MAL.3.7	Euen from the dayes of your fathers yee are gone away from mine ordinances,
b.MAL.3.8	Wil a man rob God? yet ye haue robbed me. But ye say, Wherein haue we robbed
b.MAL.3.9	Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye haue robbed me, euen this whole nation.
b.MAL.4.1	For beholde, the day commeth, that shall burne as an ouen, and all the proud,
b.MAL.4.2	But vnto you that feare my Name, shall the Sunne of righteousnesse arise with
b.MAL.4.3	And yee shall treade downe the wicked: for they shall bee ashes vnder the
b.MAL.4.4	Remember yee the Law of Moses my seruant, which I commanded vnto him in Horeb
b.MAL.4.5	Beholde, I will send you Eliiah the Prophet, before the comming of the great
b.MAL.4.6	And hee shall turne the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of
b.MAR.10.1	And he rose from thence, &amp; commeth into the coasts of Iudea by the farther
b.MAR.10.10	And in the house his disciples asked him againe of the same matter.
b.MAR.10.11	And he saith vnto them, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, and marry another,
b.MAR.10.12	And if a woman shall put away her husband, and bee married to another, she
b.MAR.10.13	And they brought yong children to him, that he should touch them, and his
b.MAR.10.14	But when Iesus saw it, hee was much displeased, and said vnto them, Suffer
b.MAR.10.15	Uerily I say vnto you, Whosoeuer shall not receiue the kingdome of God as a
b.MAR.10.16	And hee tooke them vp in his armes, put his handes vpon them, and blessed
b.MAR.10.17	And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled
b.MAR.10.18	And Iesus said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? There is no man good, but
b.MAR.10.19	Thou knowest the Commandements, Doe not commit adulterie, Doe not kill, Doe
b.MAR.10.2	And the Pharises came to him, and asked him, Is it lawfull for a man to put
b.MAR.10.20	And hee answered, and saide vnto him, Master, all these haue I obserued from
b.MAR.10.21	Then Iesus beholding him, loued him, and said vnto him, One thing thou
b.MAR.10.22	And hee was sad at that saying, and went away grieued: for hee had great
b.MAR.10.23	And Iesus looked round about, and saith vnto his disciples, How hardly shall
b.MAR.10.24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Iesus answereth againe,
b.MAR.10.25	It is easier for a camel to goe thorow the eye of a needle, then for a rich
b.MAR.10.26	And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselues, Who then
b.MAR.10.27	And Iesus looking vpon them, saith, With men it is impossible, but not with
b.MAR.10.28	Then Peter began to say vnto him, Loe, we haue left all, and haue followed
b.MAR.10.29	And Iesus answered, and said, Uerily I say vnto you, There is no man that
b.MAR.10.3	And he answered, and saide vnto them, What did Moses command you?
b.MAR.10.30	But hee shall receiue an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren,
b.MAR.10.31	But many that are first, shall be last: and the last, first.
b.MAR.10.32	And they were in the way going vp to Hierusalem: and Iesus went before them,
b.MAR.10.33	Saying, Behold, we go vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be
b.MAR.10.34	And they shall mocke him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit vpon him, and
b.MAR.10.35	And Iames, and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee come vnto him, saying, Master, we
b.MAR.10.36	And hee saide vnto them, What would ye that I should doe for you?
b.MAR.10.37	They said vnto him, Grant vnto vs that wee may sit, one on thy right hand,
b.MAR.10.38	But Iesus said vnto them, Yee know not what ye aske: Can ye drinke of the cup
b.MAR.10.39	And they said vnto him, Wee can. And Iesus said vnto them, Ye shall indeed
b.MAR.10.4	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of diuorcement, and to put her
b.MAR.10.40	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to giue, but it
b.MAR.10.41	And when the ten heard it, they beganne to bee much displeased with Iames and
b.MAR.10.42	But Iesus called them to him, and saith vnto them, Yee know that they which
b.MAR.10.43	But so shall it not be among you: but whosoeuer will bee great among you,
b.MAR.10.44	And whosoeuer of you will bee the chiefest, shalbe seruant of all.
b.MAR.10.45	For euen the Sonne of man came not to bee ministred vnto, but to minister,
b.MAR.10.46	And they came to Iericho: and as he went out of Iericho with his disciples,
b.MAR.10.47	And when he heard that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and
b.MAR.10.48	And many charged him, that he should hold his peace: But he cried the more a
b.MAR.10.49	And Iesus stood still, and commanded him to bee called: and they call the
b.MAR.10.5	And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, For the hardnesse of your heart, he
b.MAR.10.50	And hee casting away his garment, rose, and came to Iesus.
b.MAR.10.51	And Iesus answered, and said vnto him, What wilt thou that I should doe vnto
b.MAR.10.52	And Iesus saide vnto him, Goe thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole: And
b.MAR.10.6	But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male, and female.
b.MAR.10.7	For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother, and cleaue to his
b.MAR.10.8	And they twaine shalbe one flesh: so then they are no more twaine, but one
b.MAR.10.9	What therefore God hath ioyned together, let not man put asunder.
b.MAR.1.1	The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, the Sonne of God,
b.MAR.1.10	And straightway comming vp out of the water, hee saw the heauens opened, and
b.MAR.1.11	And there came a voice from heauen, saying, Thou art my beloued Sonne, in
b.MAR.11.1	And when they came nigh to Hierusalem, vnto Bethphage, and Bethanie, at the
b.MAR.11.10	Blessed be the kingdome of our father Dauid, that commeth in the Name of the
b.MAR.11.11	And Iesus entred into Hierusalem, and into the
b.MAR.11.12	And on the morow when they were come from Bethanie, hee was hungry.
b.MAR.11.13	And seeing a figtree a farre off, hauing leaues, hee came, if haply hee might
b.MAR.11.14	And Iesus answered, and said vnto it, No man eate fruite of thee hereafter
b.MAR.11.15	And they come to Hierusalem, and Iesus went into the
b.MAR.11.16	And would not suffer that any man should carie any vessell thorow the
b.MAR.11.17	And he taught, saying vnto them, Is it not written, My house shalbe called of
b.MAR.11.18	And the Scribes and chiefe Priests heard it, and sought how they might
b.MAR.11.19	And when Euen was come, Hee went out of the citie.
b.MAR.1.12	And immediately the Spirit driueth him into the wildernesse.
b.MAR.11.2	And saith vnto them, Goe your way into the village ouer against you, and
b.MAR.11.20	And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried vp from
b.MAR.11.21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith vnto him, Master, behold, the fig tree
b.MAR.11.22	And Iesus answering, saith vnto them, Haue faith in God.
b.MAR.11.23	For verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall say vnto this mountaine, Bee
b.MAR.11.24	Therfore I say vnto you, What things soeuer ye desire when ye pray, beleeue
b.MAR.11.25	And when ye stand, praying, forgiue, if ye haue ought against any: that your
b.MAR.11.26	But if you doe not forgiue, neither will your Father which is in heauen,
b.MAR.11.27	And they come againe to Hierusalem, and as he was walking in the
b.MAR.11.28	And say vnto him, By what authoritie doest thou these things? and who gaue
b.MAR.11.29	And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, I will also aske of you one
b.MAR.1.13	And he was there in the wildernesse fourtie daies tempted of Satan, and was
b.MAR.11.3	And if any man say vnto you, Why doe yee this? Say yee, that the Lord hath
b.MAR.11.30	The baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men? Answere me.
b.MAR.11.31	And they reasoned with themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he
b.MAR.11.32	But if we shall say, Of men, they feared the people: for all men counted Iohn,
b.MAR.11.33	And they answered and said vnto Iesus, We cannot tell. And Iesus answering,
b.MAR.1.14	Now after that Iohn was put in prison, Iesus came into
b.MAR.11.4	And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the doore without, in a
b.MAR.1.15	And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand: repent
b.MAR.11.5	And certaine of them that stood there, said vnto them, What doe ye loosing the
b.MAR.1.16	Now as he walked by the
b.MAR.11.6	And they said vnto them euen as Iesus had commanded: and they let them goe.
b.MAR.1.17	And Iesus said vnto them, Come ye after me; and I will make you to become
b.MAR.11.7	And they brought the colt to Iesus, and cast their garments on him, and he
b.MAR.1.18	And straightway they forsooke their nets, and followed him.
b.MAR.11.8	And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut downe branches of
b.MAR.1.19	And when hee had gone a little further thence, hee saw Iames the sonne of
b.MAR.11.9	And they that went before, and they that followed, cryed, saying, Hosanna,
b.MAR.1.2	As it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
b.MAR.1.20	And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the
b.MAR.1.21	And they went into
b.MAR.12.1	And hee began to speake vnto them by parables. A certaine man planted a
b.MAR.12.10	And haue ye not read this Scripture? The stone which the builders reiected,
b.MAR.12.11	This was the Lords doing, and it is maruellous in our eies.
b.MAR.12.12	And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people, for they knew that
b.MAR.12.13	And they send vnto him certaine of the Pharises, and of the Herodians, to
b.MAR.12.14	And when they were come, they say vnto him, Master, we know that thou art
b.MAR.12.15	Shall we giue, or shall we not giue? But he knowing their hypocrisie, said
b.MAR.12.16	And they brought it: and he saith vnto them, Whose is this image and
b.MAR.12.17	And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Render to Cesar the things that are
b.MAR.12.18	Then come vnto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection, and
b.MAR.12.19	Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If a mans brother die, and leaue his wife behind
b.MAR.1.22	And they were astonished at his doctrine: for hee taught them as one that had
b.MAR.12.2	And at the season, he sent to the husbandmen a seruant, that he might receiue
b.MAR.12.20	Now there were seuen brethren: and the first tooke a wife, and dying left no
b.MAR.12.21	And the second tooke her, and died, neither left he any seed, and the third
b.MAR.12.22	And the seuen had her, and left no seede: last of all the woman died also.
b.MAR.12.23	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be
b.MAR.12.24	And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Doe ye not therefore erre, because yee
b.MAR.12.25	For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are giuen in
b.MAR.12.26	And as touching the dead, that they rise: haue ye not read in the booke of
b.MAR.12.27	Hee is not the God of the dead, but the God of the liuing: yee therefore doe
b.MAR.12.28	And one of the Scribes came, and hauing heard them reasoning together, and
b.MAR.12.29	And Iesus answered him, The first of al the commandements is, Heare, O
b.MAR.1.23	And there was in their Synagogue a man with an vncleane spirit, and he cried
b.MAR.12.3	And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away emptie.
b.MAR.12.30	And thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
b.MAR.12.31	And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy
b.MAR.12.32	And the Scribe said vnto him, Well master, thou hast said the truth: for
b.MAR.12.33	And to loue him with all the heart, and with all the vnderstanding, and with
b.MAR.12.34	And when Iesus saw that he answered discreetly, hee saide vnto him, Thou art
b.MAR.12.35	And Iesus answered, and said, while hee taught in the
b.MAR.12.36	For Dauid himselfe said by the holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou
b.MAR.12.37	Dauid therefore himselfe calleth him Lord, and whence is hee then his sonne?
b.MAR.12.38	And he said vnto them in his doctrine, Beware of the Scribes, which loue to
b.MAR.12.39	And the chiefe seates in the Synagogues, and the vppermost roomes at feasts:
b.MAR.1.24	Saying, Let vs alone, what haue we to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth?
b.MAR.12.4	And againe, hee sent vnto them another seruant; and at him they cast stones,
b.MAR.12.40	Which deuoure widowes houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: These
b.MAR.12.41	And Iesus sate ouer against the treasurie, and beheld how the people cast
b.MAR.12.42	And there came a certaine poore widow, and she threw in two mites, which make
b.MAR.12.43	And he called vnto him his disciples, and saith vnto them, Uerily I say vnto
b.MAR.12.44	For all they did cast in of their aboundance: but she of her want, did cast
b.MAR.1.25	And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
b.MAR.12.5	And againe, he sent another, and him they killed: and many others, beating
b.MAR.1.26	And when the vncleane spirit had torne him, and cried with a lowd voice, he
b.MAR.12.6	Hauing yet therefore one sonne his welbeloued, he sent him also last vnto
b.MAR.1.27	And they were all amased, insomuch that they questioned among themselues,
b.MAR.12.7	But those husbandmen said amongst themselues, This is the heire, come, let vs
b.MAR.1.28	And immediatly his fame spread abroad throughout al the region round about
b.MAR.12.8	And they tooke him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
b.MAR.1.29	And forth with, when they were come out of the Synagogue, they entered into
b.MAR.12.9	What shall therefore the Lord of the vineyard doe? He will come and destroy
b.MAR.1.3	The voice of one crying in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
b.MAR.1.30	But Simons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer: and anone they tell him of her.
b.MAR.1.31	And he came and tooke her by the hand, and lift her vp, and immediately the
b.MAR.13.1	And as he went out of the
b.MAR.13.10	And the Gospel must first be published among all nations.
b.MAR.13.11	But when they shall lead you, and deliuer you vp, take no thought before hand
b.MAR.13.12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the sonne:
b.MAR.13.13	And ye shall bee hated of all men for my Names sake: but hee that shall
b.MAR.13.14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the
b.MAR.13.15	And let him that is on the house top, not goe downe into the house, neither
b.MAR.13.16	And let him that is in the field, not turne backe againe for to take vp his
b.MAR.13.17	But woe to them that are with child, and to them that giue suck in those
b.MAR.13.18	And pray ye that your flight bee not in the winter.
b.MAR.13.19	For in those dayes shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of
b.MAR.1.32	And at euen, when the Sunne did set, they brought vnto him all that were
b.MAR.13.2	And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there
b.MAR.13.20	And except that the Lord had shortened those dayes, no flesh should be saued:
b.MAR.13.21	And then, if any man shall say to you, Loe, here is Christ, or loe, hee is
b.MAR.13.22	For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shewe signes and
b.MAR.13.23	But take ye heed: behold, I haue foretold you all things.
b.MAR.13.24	But in those dayes, after that tribulation, the Sunne shalbe darkned, and the
b.MAR.13.25	And the Starres of heauen shall fall, and the powers that are in heauen shall
b.MAR.13.26	And then shal they see the Sonne of man comming in the cloudes, with great
b.MAR.13.27	And then shal he send his Angels, and shall gather together his elect from
b.MAR.13.28	Now learne a parable of the fig tree. When her branch is yet tender, and
b.MAR.13.29	So ye in like maner, when ye shal see these things come to passe, knowe that
b.MAR.1.33	And all the citie was gathered together at the doore.
b.MAR.13.3	And as he sate vpon the mount of Oliues, ouer against the
b.MAR.13.30	Uerely I say vnto you, that this generation shall not passe, till all these
b.MAR.13.31	Heauen and earth shal passe away: but my words shall not passe away.
b.MAR.13.32	But of that day and that houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in
b.MAR.13.33	Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
b.MAR.13.34	For the Sonne of man is as a man taking a farre iourney, who left his house,
b.MAR.13.35	Watch ye therefore (for ye knowe not when the master of the house commeth, at
b.MAR.13.36	Lest comming suddenly, he finde you sleeping.
b.MAR.13.37	And what I say vnto you, I say vnto all, Watch.
b.MAR.1.34	And he healed many that were sicke of diuers diseases, and cast out many
b.MAR.13.4	Tell vs, when shall these things be? And what shalbe the signe when all these
b.MAR.1.35	And in the morning, rising vp a great while before day, hee went out, and
b.MAR.13.5	And Iesus answering them, began to say, Take heed lest any man deceiue you.
b.MAR.1.36	And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him:
b.MAR.13.6	For many shal come in my Name, saying, I am Christ: and shall deceiue many.
b.MAR.1.37	And when they had found him, they said vnto him, All men seek for thee.
b.MAR.13.7	And when yee shall heare of warres, and rumors of warres, be yee not troubled:
b.MAR.1.38	And he said vnto them, Let vs goe into ye next townes, that I may preach
b.MAR.13.8	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome: and there
b.MAR.1.39	And he preached in their Synagogues throughout all
b.MAR.13.9	But take heed to your selues: for they shall deliuer you vp to councels, and
b.MAR.1.4	Iohn did baptize in the wildernesse, and preach the baptisme of repentance,
b.MAR.1.40	And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling downe to him, and
b.MAR.1.41	And Iesus mooued with compassion, put foorth his hand, and touched him, and
b.MAR.14.1	After two dayes was the feast of the Passeouer, and of vnleauened bread: and
b.MAR.14.10	And Iudas Iscariot, one of the twelue, went vnto the chiefe Priests, to
b.MAR.14.11	And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to giue him money. And
b.MAR.14.12	And the first day of vnleauened bread, when they killed the Passeouer, his
b.MAR.14.13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith vnto them, Goe yee into
b.MAR.14.14	And wheresoeuer he shall goe in, say yee to the good man of the house, The
b.MAR.14.15	And he will shew you a large vpper roome furnished, and prepared: there make
b.MAR.14.16	And his disciples went forth, and came into the citie, and found as hee had
b.MAR.14.17	And in the euening hee commeth with the twelue.
b.MAR.14.18	And as they sate, and did eat, Iesus said, Uerily I say vnto you, one of you
b.MAR.14.19	And they began to be sorowfull, and to say vnto him, one by one, Is it I? And
b.MAR.1.42	And assoone as he had spoken, immediately the leprosie departed from him, and
b.MAR.14.2	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an vprore of the people.
b.MAR.14.20	And he answered, and saide vnto them, It is one of the twelue, that dippeth
b.MAR.14.21	The sonne of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man
b.MAR.14.22	And as they did eate, Iesus tooke bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gaue
b.MAR.14.23	And he tooke the cup, and when he had giuen thanks, he gaue it to them: and
b.MAR.14.24	And he said vnto them, This is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed
b.MAR.14.25	Uerely I say vnto you, I will drinke no more of the fruit of the Uine, vntill
b.MAR.14.26	And when they had sung an hymne, they went out into the mount of Oliues.
b.MAR.14.27	And Iesus saith vnto them, All ye shall be offended because of mee this
b.MAR.14.28	But after that I am risen, I will goe before you into
b.MAR.14.29	But Peter said vnto him, Although al shalbe offended, yet wil not I.
b.MAR.1.43	And he straitly charged him, and forth with sent him away,
b.MAR.14.3	And being in Bethanie, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sate at meat,
b.MAR.14.30	And Iesus saith vnto him, Uerily I say vnto thee, that this day, euen in this
b.MAR.14.31	But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not denie
b.MAR.14.32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemani, and hee saith to his
b.MAR.14.33	And hee taketh with him Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and began to be sore
b.MAR.14.34	And saith vnto them, My soule is exceeding sorowful vnto death: tarie ye
b.MAR.14.35	And he went forward a litle, and fell on the ground, and prayed, that if it
b.MAR.14.36	And he said, Abba, father, all things are possible vnto thee, take away this
b.MAR.14.37	And hee commeth, and findeth them sleeping, and saith vnto Peter, Simon,
b.MAR.14.38	Watch ye and pray, lest yee enter into temptation: The spirit truly is ready,
b.MAR.14.39	And againe he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
b.MAR.1.44	And saith vnto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but goe thy way, shew
b.MAR.14.4	And there were some that had indignation within themselues, and said, Why was
b.MAR.14.40	And when he returned, he found them asleepe againe, (for their eies were
b.MAR.14.41	And he commeth the third time, and saith vnto them, Sleepe on now, and take
b.MAR.14.42	Rise vp, let vs goe, Loe, he that betrayeth me, is at hand.
b.MAR.14.43	And immediately, while hee yet spake, commeth Iudas, one of the twelue, and
b.MAR.14.44	And he that betrayed him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomsoeuer I shall
b.MAR.14.45	And assoone as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and sayeth, Master,
b.MAR.14.46	And they layed their hands on him, and tooke him.
b.MAR.14.47	And one of them that stood by, drew a sword, and smote a seruant of the high
b.MAR.14.48	And Iesus answered, &amp; said vnto the, Are ye come out as against a theefe,
b.MAR.14.49	I was daily with you in the
b.MAR.1.45	But he went out, and beganne to publish it much, and to blase abroad the
b.MAR.14.5	For it might haue bene solde for more then three hundred pence, and haue bene
b.MAR.14.50	And they all forsooke him, &amp; fled.
b.MAR.14.51	And there followed him a certaine yong man, hauing a linnen cloth cast about
b.MAR.14.52	And he left the linnen cloth, and fled from them naked.
b.MAR.14.53	And they led Iesus away to the high Priest, and with him were assembled all
b.MAR.14.54	And Peter followed him a farre off, euen into the pallace of the high Priest:
b.MAR.14.55	And the chiefe Priests, and all the counsell sought for witnesse against
b.MAR.14.56	For many bare false witnesse against him, but their witnesse agreed not
b.MAR.14.57	And there arose certaine, and bare false witnesse against him, saying,
b.MAR.14.58	We heard him say, I will destroy this
b.MAR.14.59	But neither so did their witnesse agree together.
b.MAR.14.6	And Iesus said, Let her alone, why trouble you her? Shee hath wrought a good
b.MAR.14.60	And the high Priest stood vp in the mids, and asked Iesus, saying, Answerest
b.MAR.14.61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Againe, the high Priest asked
b.MAR.14.62	And Iesus said, I am: and yee shall see the sonne of man sitting on the right
b.MAR.14.63	Then the high Priest rent his clothes, and saith, What neede we any further
b.MAR.14.64	Yee haue heard the blasphemy: what thinke yee? And they all condemned him to
b.MAR.14.65	And some beganne to spit on him, and to couer his face, and to buffet him,
b.MAR.14.66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there commeth one of the maides of
b.MAR.14.67	And when she saw Peter warning himselfe, she looked vpon him, and said, And
b.MAR.14.68	But hee denied, saying, I know not, neither vnderstand I what thou sayest.
b.MAR.14.69	And a maide saw him againe, and beganne to say to them that stood by, This is
b.MAR.14.7	For ye haue the poore with you alwayes, and whensoeuer ye will yee may doe
b.MAR.14.70	And he denied it againe. And a little after, they that stood by said againe
b.MAR.14.71	But he beganne to curse and to sweare, saying, I know not this man of whom
b.MAR.14.72	And the second time the cocke crew: and Peter called to minde the word that
b.MAR.14.8	She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the
b.MAR.14.9	Uerely I say vnto you, Wheresoeuer this Gospel shalbe preached thorowout the
b.MAR.1.5	And there went out vnto him all the land of Iudea, and they of Ierusalem, and
b.MAR.15.1	And straightway in the morning the chiefe Priests helde a consultation with
b.MAR.15.10	(For hee knew that the chiefe Priests had deliuered him for enuie.)
b.MAR.15.11	But the chiefe Priests mooued the people, that hee should rather release
b.MAR.15.12	And Pilate answered, and said againe vnto them, What will yee then that I
b.MAR.15.13	And they cried out againe, Crucifie him.
b.MAR.15.14	Then Pilate saide vnto them, Why, what euill hath hee done? And they cried
b.MAR.15.15	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas vnto them,
b.MAR.15.16	And the souldiers led him away into the hall, called Pretorium, and they call
b.MAR.15.17	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crowne of thornes, and put it
b.MAR.15.18	And beganne to salute him, Haile King of the Iewes.
b.MAR.15.19	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit vpon him, and bowing
b.MAR.15.2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Iewes? And hee answering, said
b.MAR.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they tooke off the purple from him, and put his
b.MAR.15.21	And they compell one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, comming out of the
b.MAR.15.22	And they bring him vnto the place
b.MAR.15.23	And they gaue him to drinke, wine mingled with myrrhe: but he receiued it
b.MAR.15.24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots vpon
b.MAR.15.25	And it was the third houre, and they crucified him.
b.MAR.15.26	And the superscription of his accusation was written ouer, THE KING OF THE
b.MAR.15.27	And with him they crucifie two theeues, the one on his right hand, and the
b.MAR.15.28	And the Scripture was fulfilled, which sayeth, And hee was numbred with the
b.MAR.15.29	And they that passed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah
b.MAR.15.3	And the chiefe Priests accused him of many things: but hee answered nothing.
b.MAR.15.30	Saue thy selfe, and come downe from the Crosse.
b.MAR.15.31	Likewise also the chiefe Priests mocking, said among themselues with the
b.MAR.15.32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the Crosse, that we may see
b.MAR.15.33	And when the sixth houre was come, there was darkenesse ouer the whole land,
b.MAR.15.34	And at the ninth houre, Iesus cryed with a loude voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi,
b.MAR.15.35	And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth
b.MAR.15.36	And one ranne, and filled a spunge full of vineger, and put it on a reed, and
b.MAR.15.37	And Iesus cryed with a loude voice, and gaue vp the ghost.
b.MAR.15.38	And the vaile of the
b.MAR.15.39	And when the Centurion which stood ouer against him, saw that hee so cryed
b.MAR.15.4	And Pilate asked him againe, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many
b.MAR.15.40	There were also women looking on afarre off, among whom was Mary Magdalene,
b.MAR.15.41	Who also when hee was in Galile, followed him, and ministred vnto him, and
b.MAR.15.42	And now when the euen was come, (because it was the Preparation, that is, the
b.MAR.15.43	Ioseph of Arimathea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the
b.MAR.15.44	And Pilate marueiled if he were already dead, and calling vnto him the
b.MAR.15.45	And when he knew it of the Centurion, he gaue the body to Ioseph.
b.MAR.15.46	And hee bought fine linnen, and tooke him downe, and wrapped him in the
b.MAR.15.47	And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Ioses behelde where he was laide.
b.MAR.15.5	But Iesus yet answered nothing, so that Pilate marueiled.
b.MAR.15.6	Now at that Feast he released vnto them one prisoner, whomsoeuer they desired.
b.MAR.15.7	And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made
b.MAR.15.8	And the multitude crying alowd, began to desire him to doe as he had euer done
b.MAR.15.9	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release vnto you the King of
b.MAR.1.6	And Iohn was clothed with camels haire, and with a girdle of a skin about his
b.MAR.16.1	And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Iames,
b.MAR.16.10	And she went and told them that had beene with him, as they mourned and wept.
b.MAR.16.11	And they, when they had heard that he was aliue, and had beene seene of her,
b.MAR.16.12	After that, he appeared in another forme vnto two of them, as they walked,
b.MAR.16.13	And they went and tolde it vnto the residue, neither beleeued they them.
b.MAR.16.14	Afterward he appeared vnto the eleuen, as they sate at meat, and vpbraided
b.MAR.16.15	And he said vnto them, Goe yee into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
b.MAR.16.16	He that beleeueth and is baptized, shalbe saued, but he that beleeueth not,
b.MAR.16.17	And these signes shal follow them that beleeue, In my Name shall they cast
b.MAR.16.18	They shall take vp serpents, and if they drinke any deadly thing, it shall
b.MAR.16.19	So then after the Lord had spoken vnto them, he was receiued vp into heauen,
b.MAR.16.2	And very early in the morning, the first day of the week they came vnto the
b.MAR.16.20	And they went foorth, and preached euery where, the Lord working with them,
b.MAR.16.3	And they said among themselues, who shall roll vs away the stone from the
b.MAR.16.4	(And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away) for it was
b.MAR.16.5	And entring into the sepulchre, they sawe a young man sitting on the right
b.MAR.16.6	And hee sayth vnto them, Be not affrighted; ye seeke Iesus of Nazareth, which
b.MAR.16.7	But goe your way, tell his disciples, and Peter, that hee goeth before you
b.MAR.16.8	And they went out quickely, and fledde from the sepulchre, for they trembled,
b.MAR.16.9	Now when Iesus was risen early, the first day of the weeke, he appeared first
b.MAR.1.7	And preached, saying, There commeth one mightier then I after me, the latchet
b.MAR.1.8	I indeed haue baptized you with water: but hee shall baptize you with the holy
b.MAR.1.9	And it came to passe in those daies, that Iesus came from Nazareth of Galilee,
b.MAR.2.1	And againe hee entred into
b.MAR.2.10	But that yee may know that the Sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue
b.MAR.2.11	I say vnto thee, Arise, &amp; take vp thy bed, &amp; goe thy way into thine
b.MAR.2.12	And immediatly he arose, tooke vp the bed, and went foorth before them all,
b.MAR.2.13	And he went foorth againe by the sea side, and all the multitude resorted
b.MAR.2.14	And as he passed by, he saw Leui the son of
b.MAR.2.15	And it came to passe, that as Iesus sate at meate in his house, many
b.MAR.2.16	And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him eate with Publicanes and sinners,
b.MAR.2.17	When Iesus heard it, he saith vnto them, They that are whole, haue no need of
b.MAR.2.18	And the disciples of Iohn, and of the Pharisees vsed to fast; and they come,
b.MAR.2.19	And Iesus said vnto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while
b.MAR.2.2	And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no roome
b.MAR.2.20	But the dayes will come, when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them,
b.MAR.2.21	No man also soweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece
b.MAR.2.22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the new wine doeth burst
b.MAR.2.23	And it came to passe, that he went thorow the corne fields on the Sabbath
b.MAR.2.24	And the Pharisees saide vnto him, Behold, why do they on the Sabbath day that
b.MAR.2.25	And he said vnto them, Haue ye neuer read what Dauid did, when hee had need,
b.MAR.2.26	How hee went into the house of God in the dayes of Abiathar the high Priest,
b.MAR.2.27	And hee said vnto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
b.MAR.2.28	Therefore the Sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.
b.MAR.2.3	And they come vnto him, bringing one sicke of the palsie, which was borne of
b.MAR.2.4	And when they could not come nigh vnto him for preasse, they vncouered the
b.MAR.2.5	When Iesus saw their faith, hee said vnto the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, thy
b.MAR.2.6	But there were certaine of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their
b.MAR.2.7	Why doeth this man thus speake blasphemies? Who can forgiue sinnes but God
b.MAR.2.8	And immediatly, when Iesus perceiued in his Spirit, that they so reasoned
b.MAR.2.9	Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie, Thy sinnes be forgiuen
b.MAR.3.1	And he entred againe into the Synagogue, and there was a man there which had a
b.MAR.3.10	For he had healed many, insomuch that they preassed vpon him, for to touch
b.MAR.3.11	And vncleane spirits, when they saw him, fell downe before him, and cried,
b.MAR.3.12	And he straitly charged them, that they should not make him knowen.
b.MAR.3.13	And he goeth vp into a mountaine, and calleth vnto him whom he would: and
b.MAR.3.14	And he ordeined twelue, that they should be with him, and that hee might send
b.MAR.3.15	And to haue power to heale sickenesses, and to cast out deuils.
b.MAR.3.16	And Simon he surnamed Peter.
b.MAR.3.17	And Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn the brother of Iames (and he
b.MAR.3.18	And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and Iames
b.MAR.3.19	And Iudas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
b.MAR.3.2	And they watched him, whether hee would heale him on the Sabbath day, that
b.MAR.3.20	And the multitude commeth together againe, so that they could not so much as
b.MAR.3.21	And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him, for they
b.MAR.3.22	And the Scribes which came downe from Hierusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub,
b.MAR.3.23	And he called them vnto him, and said vnto them in parables, Howe can Satan
b.MAR.3.24	And if a kingdome be diuided against it selfe, that kingdome cannot stand.
b.MAR.3.25	And if a house be diuided against it selfe, that house cannot stand.
b.MAR.3.26	And if Satan rise vp against himselfe, and be diuided, hee cannot stand, but
b.MAR.3.27	No man can enter into a strong mans house, and spoile his goods, except he
b.MAR.3.28	Uerely I say vnto you, All sinnes shalbe forgiuen vnto the sonnes of men, and
b.MAR.3.29	But he that shal blaspheme against the holy Ghost, hath neuer forgiuenesse,
b.MAR.3.3	And he saith vnto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
b.MAR.3.30	Because they said, He hath an vncleane spirit.
b.MAR.3.31	There came then his brethren, and his mother, and standing without, sent vnto
b.MAR.3.32	And the multitude sate about him and they said vnto him, Behold, thy mother
b.MAR.3.33	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
b.MAR.3.34	And he looked round about on them which sate about him, and saide, Behold my
b.MAR.3.35	For whosoeuer shall doe the will of God, the same is my brother, and my
b.MAR.3.4	And hee saith vnto them, Is it lawfull to doe good on the Sabbath dayes, or to
b.MAR.3.5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieued for the
b.MAR.3.6	And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway tooke counsel with the Herodians
b.MAR.3.7	But Iesus withdrew himselfe with his disciples to the Sea: and a great
b.MAR.3.8	And from Hierusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Iordane, and they about
b.MAR.3.9	And he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him, because of
b.MAR.4.1	And he beganne againe to teach by the Sea side: and there was gathered vnto
b.MAR.4.10	And when hee was alone, they that were about him, with the twelue, asked of
b.MAR.4.11	And he said vnto them, Unto you it is giuen to know the mystery of the
b.MAR.4.12	That seeing they may see, and not perceiue, and hearing they may heare, and
b.MAR.4.13	And he said vnto them, Know ye not this parable? And how then will you know
b.MAR.4.14	The Sower soweth the word.
b.MAR.4.15	And these are they by the way side, where the word is sowen, but when they
b.MAR.4.16	And these are they likewise which are sowen on stonie ground, who when they
b.MAR.4.17	And haue no roote in themselues, and so endure but for a time: afterward when
b.MAR.4.18	And these are they which are sowen among thorns: such as heare the word,
b.MAR.4.19	And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulnesse of riches, and the lusts
b.MAR.4.2	And he taught them many things by parables, and said vnto them in his
b.MAR.4.20	And these are they which are sowen on good ground, such as heare the word,
b.MAR.4.21	And he said vnto them, Is a candle brought to be put vnder a bushell, or
b.MAR.4.22	For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested: neither was any
b.MAR.4.23	If any man haue eares to heare, let him heare.
b.MAR.4.24	And he said vnto them, Take heed what you heare: With what measure ye mete,
b.MAR.4.25	For he that hath, to him shall be giuen: and he that hath not, from him shall
b.MAR.4.26	And he said, So is the kingdome of God, as if a man should cast seede into
b.MAR.4.27	And should sleepe, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring, and
b.MAR.4.28	For the earth bringeth foorth fruite of herselfe, first the blade, then the
b.MAR.4.29	But when the fruite is brought foorth, immediately he putteth in the sickle,
b.MAR.4.3	Hearken, Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
b.MAR.4.30	And he said, Wherunto shal we liken the kingdome of God? Or with what
b.MAR.4.31	It is like a graine of mustard seed: which when it is sowen in the earth, is
b.MAR.4.32	But when it is sowen, it groweth vp, and becommeth greater then all herbes,
b.MAR.4.33	And with many such parables spake hee the word vnto them, as they were able
b.MAR.4.34	But without a parable spake he not vnto them, and when they were alone, hee
b.MAR.4.35	And the same day, when the Euen was come, he saith vnto them, Let vs passe
b.MAR.4.36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they tooke him, euen as he was in
b.MAR.4.37	And there arose a great storme of wind, and the waues beat into the ship, so
b.MAR.4.38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship asleepe on a pillow: and they awake
b.MAR.4.39	And hee arose, and rebuked the winde, and said vnto the sea, Peace, be still:
b.MAR.4.4	And it came to passe as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the foules of
b.MAR.4.40	And he said vnto them, Why are ye so fearefull? How is it that you haue no
b.MAR.4.41	And they feared exceedingly, and saide one to another, What maner of man is
b.MAR.4.5	And some fell on stonie ground, where it had not much earth: and immediately
b.MAR.4.6	But when the Sunne was vp, it was scorched, and because it had no roote, it
b.MAR.4.7	And some fell among thornes, and the thornes grew vp, and choked it, and it
b.MAR.4.8	And other fell on good ground, and did yeeld fruite that sprang vp, and
b.MAR.4.9	And he said vnto them, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.
b.MAR.5.1	And they came ouer vnto the other side of the sea, into the countrey of the
b.MAR.5.10	And hee besought him much, that he would not send them away out of the
b.MAR.5.11	Now there was there nigh vnto the mountaines a great herd of swine, feeding.
b.MAR.5.12	And all the deuils besought him, saying, Send vs into the swine, that we may
b.MAR.5.13	And forthwith Iesus gaue them leaue. And the vncleane spirits went out, and
b.MAR.5.14	And they that fed the swine fled, and tolde it in the citie, and in the
b.MAR.5.15	And they come to Iesus, and see him that was possessed with the deuill, and
b.MAR.5.16	And they that saw it, tolde them how it befell to him that was possessed with
b.MAR.5.17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
b.MAR.5.18	And when hee was come into the ship, he that had bene possessed with the
b.MAR.5.19	Howbeit Iesus suffered him not, but saith vnto him, Goe home to thy friends,
b.MAR.5.2	And when hee was come out of the ship, immediatly there met him out of the
b.MAR.5.20	And hee departed, and began to publish in
b.MAR.5.21	And when Iesus was passed ouer againe by ship vnto the other side, much
b.MAR.5.22	And behold, there commeth one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, Iairus by name,
b.MAR.5.23	And besought him greatly, saying, My litle daughter lieth at the point of
b.MAR.5.24	And Iesus went with him, and much people followed him, and thronged him.
b.MAR.5.25	And a certaine woman which had an issue of blood twelue yeeres,
b.MAR.5.26	And had suffered many things of many Physicians, and had spent all that she
b.MAR.5.27	When shee had heard of Iesus, came in the prease behinde, and touched his
b.MAR.5.28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shalbe whole.
b.MAR.5.29	And straightway the fountaine of her blood was dried vp: and she felt in her
b.MAR.5.3	Who had his dwelling among the tombs, and no man could binde him, no not with
b.MAR.5.30	And Iesus immediatly knowing in himselfe that vertue had gone out of him,
b.MAR.5.31	And his disciples said vnto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and
b.MAR.5.32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
b.MAR.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and
b.MAR.5.34	And he said vnto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole, goe in peace,
b.MAR.5.35	While hee yet spake, there came from the Ruler of the Synagogues house,
b.MAR.5.36	Assoone as Iesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith vnto the Ruler of
b.MAR.5.37	And he suffered no man to follow him, saue Peter, &amp; Iames, and Iohn the
b.MAR.5.38	And hee commeth to the house of the Ruler of the Synagogue, and seeth the
b.MAR.5.39	And when he was come in, hee saith vnto them, Why make yee this adoe, and
b.MAR.5.4	Because that hee had bene often bound with fetters and chaines, and the
b.MAR.5.40	And they laughed him to scorne: but when he had put them all out, hee taketh
b.MAR.5.41	And he tooke the damosell by the hand, and said vnto her, Talitha cumi, which
b.MAR.5.42	And straightway the damosell arose, and walked, for shee was of the age of
b.MAR.5.43	And hee charged them straitly, that no man should know it: and commanded that
b.MAR.5.5	And alwayes night and day, hee was in the mountaines, and in the tombes,
b.MAR.5.6	But when hee saw Iesus afarre off, he came and worshipped him,
b.MAR.5.7	And cried with a lowd voice, and said, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus,
b.MAR.5.8	(For he said vnto him, Come out of the man, thou vncleane spirit.)
b.MAR.5.9	And he asked him, What is thy name? And hee answered, saying, My name is
b.MAR.6.1	And hee went out from thence, and came into his owne countrey, and his
b.MAR.6.10	And he said vnto them, In what place soeuer yee enter into an house, there
b.MAR.6.11	And whosoeuer shall not receiue you, nor heare you, when yee depart thence,
b.MAR.6.12	And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
b.MAR.6.13	And they cast out many deuils, and anointed with oyle many, that were sicke,
b.MAR.6.14	And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abroad:) and hee said
b.MAR.6.15	Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a Prophet, or as
b.MAR.6.16	But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is Iohn, whome I beheaded, he is
b.MAR.6.17	For Herod himselfe had sent forth and laid hold vpon Iohn, and bound him in
b.MAR.6.18	For Iohn had said vnto Herod, It is not lawfull for thee to haue thy brothers
b.MAR.6.19	Therfore Herodias had a quarrel against him, &amp; would haue killed him, but
b.MAR.6.2	And when the Sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the Synagogue: and
b.MAR.6.20	For Herod feared Iohn, knowing that he was a iust man, and an holy, and
b.MAR.6.21	And when a conuenient day was come, that Herod on his birth day made a supper
b.MAR.6.22	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased
b.MAR.6.23	And he sware vnto her, Whatsoeuer thou shalt aske of me, I will giue it thee,
b.MAR.6.24	And she went forth, and said vnto her mother, What shall I aske? And she
b.MAR.6.25	And she came in straightway with haste, vnto the king, and asked, saying, I
b.MAR.6.26	And the king was exceeding sory, yet for his othes sake, and for their sakes
b.MAR.6.27	And immediatly the king sent an executioner, and commaunded his head to be
b.MAR.6.28	And brought his head in a charger, and gaue it to the damosell, and the
b.MAR.6.29	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and tooke vp his corpse, and
b.MAR.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the sonne of Mary, the brother of Iames and Ioses,
b.MAR.6.30	And the Apostles gathered themselues together vnto Iesus, and tolde him all
b.MAR.6.31	And he said vnto them, Come yee your selues apart into a desert place, and
b.MAR.6.32	And they departed into a desert place by ship priuately.
b.MAR.6.33	And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ranne afoote
b.MAR.6.34	And Iesus when he came out, saw much people, and was moued with compassion
b.MAR.6.35	And when the day was now far spent, his Disciples came vnto him, and said,
b.MAR.6.36	Send them away, that they may goe into the countrey round about, and into the
b.MAR.6.37	He answered and said vnto them, Giue yee them to eate. And they say vnto him,
b.MAR.6.38	He saith vnto them, How many loaues haue yee? goe, and see. And when they
b.MAR.6.39	And he commanded them to make all sit downe by companies vpon the greene
b.MAR.6.4	But Iesus sayde vnto them, A Prophet is not without honour, but in his owne
b.MAR.6.40	And they sate downe in rankes by hundreds, and by fifties.
b.MAR.6.41	And when he had taken the fiue loaues, and the two fishes, he looked vp to
b.MAR.6.42	And they did all eate, and were filled.
b.MAR.6.43	And they tooke vp twelue baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
b.MAR.6.44	And they that did eate of the loaues, were about fiue thousand men.
b.MAR.6.45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to goe
b.MAR.6.46	And when hee had sent them away, he departed into a mountaine to pray.
b.MAR.6.47	And when Euen was come, the ship was in the midst of the Sea, and he alone on
b.MAR.6.48	And he saw them toiling in rowing (for the wind was contrary vnto them:) and
b.MAR.6.49	But when they saw him walking vpon the Sea, they supposed it had bene a
b.MAR.6.5	And he could there doe no mightie worke, saue that he laid his hands vpon a
b.MAR.6.50	(For they all saw him, and were troubled) and immediately hee talked with
b.MAR.6.51	And hee went vp vnto them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were
b.MAR.6.52	For they considered not the miracle of the loaues, for their heart was
b.MAR.6.53	And when they had passed ouer, they came into the
b.MAR.6.54	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
b.MAR.6.55	And ran through that whole region round about, and beganne to carrie about in
b.MAR.6.56	And whithersouer he entred, into villages, or cities, or countrie, they laide
b.MAR.6.6	And he marueiled because of their vnbeliefe. And he went round about the
b.MAR.6.7	And he calleth vnto him the twelue, and began to send them foorth, by two and
b.MAR.6.8	And commanded them that they should take nothing for their iourney, saue a
b.MAR.6.9	But be shod with sandales: and not put on two coats.
b.MAR.7.1	Then came together vnto him the Pharises, and certain of the Scribes, which
b.MAR.7.10	For Moses said, Honour thy father &amp; thy mother: and who so curseth father
b.MAR.7.11	But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is
b.MAR.7.12	And ye suffer him no more to doe ought for his father, or his mother:
b.MAR.7.13	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye haue
b.MAR.7.14	And when he had called all the people vnto him, hee said vnto them, Hearken
b.MAR.7.15	There is nothing from without a man that entring into him, can defile him:
b.MAR.7.16	If any man haue eares to heare, let him heare.
b.MAR.7.17	And when hee was entred into the house from the people, his disciples asked
b.MAR.7.18	And he saith vnto them, Are ye so without vnderstanding also? Doe yee not
b.MAR.7.19	Because it entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into
b.MAR.7.2	And when they saw some of his disciples eate bread with defiled (that is to
b.MAR.7.20	And he said, That which commeth out of the man, that defileth the man.
b.MAR.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed euill thoughts, adulteries,
b.MAR.7.22	Thefts, couetousnesse, wickednesse, deceit, lasciuiousnesse, an euill eye,
b.MAR.7.23	All these euill things come from within, and defile the man.
b.MAR.7.24	And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of
b.MAR.7.25	For a certaine woman, whose yong daughter had an vncleane spirit, heard of
b.MAR.7.26	(The woman was a Greek: a Syrophenician by nation:) and she besought him that
b.MAR.7.27	But Iesus said vnto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet
b.MAR.7.28	And she answered and said vnto him, Yes Lord, yet the dogges vnder the table
b.MAR.7.29	And hee said vnto her, For this saying, goe thy way, the deuill is gone out
b.MAR.7.3	For the Pharises and all the Iewes, except they wash their hands oft, eate
b.MAR.7.30	And when shee was come to her house, she found the deuill gone out, and her
b.MAR.7.31	And againe departing from the coastes of
b.MAR.7.32	And they bring vnto him one that was deafe, and had an impediment in his
b.MAR.7.33	And he tooke him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his eares,
b.MAR.7.34	And looking vp to heauen, hee sighed, and saith vnto him, Ephphatha, that is,
b.MAR.7.35	And straightway his eares were opened, and the string of his tongue was
b.MAR.7.36	And hee charged them that they should tell no man: but the more hee charged
b.MAR.7.37	And were beyond measure astonished, saying, Hee hath done all things well:
b.MAR.7.4	And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eate not. And many
b.MAR.7.5	Then the Pharises and Scribes asked him, Why walke not thy disciples according
b.MAR.7.6	He answered and said vnto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you Hypocrites,
b.MAR.7.7	Howbeit in vaine doe they worship me, teaching for doctrines, the
b.MAR.7.8	For laying aside the Commandement of God, yee hold the tradition of men, as
b.MAR.7.9	And he said vnto them, Full well ye reiect the Commandement of God, that ye
b.MAR.8.1	In those dayes the multitude being very great, and hauing nothing to eat.
b.MAR.8.10	And straightway he entred into a ship with his disciples, and came into the
b.MAR.8.11	And the Pharisees came foorth, and began to question with him, seeking of him
b.MAR.8.12	And he sighed deepely in his spirit, and saith, Why doeth this generation
b.MAR.8.13	And he left them, &amp; entring into the ship againe, departed to the other
b.MAR.8.14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship
b.MAR.8.15	And hee charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leauen of the
b.MAR.8.16	And they reasoned among themselues, saying, It is, because we haue no bread.
b.MAR.8.17	And when Iesus knew it, he saith vnto them, Why reason ye, because yee haue
b.MAR.8.18	Hauing eyes, see ye not? and hauing eares heare ye not? And doe ye not
b.MAR.8.19	When I brake the fiue loaues among fiue thousand, how many baskets full of
b.MAR.8.2	I haue compassion on the multitude, because they haue now bene with me three
b.MAR.8.20	And when the seuen among foure thousand: how many baskets full of fragments
b.MAR.8.21	And he said vnto them, How is it that ye doe not vnderstand?
b.MAR.8.22	And he commeth to Bethsaida, and they bring a blind man vnto him, and
b.MAR.8.23	And he tooke the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the towne, and
b.MAR.8.24	And he looked vp, and saide, I see men as trees, walking.
b.MAR.8.25	After that hee put his handes againe vpon his eies, and made him look vp: and
b.MAR.8.26	And hee sent him away to his house, saying, Neither goe into the towne, nor
b.MAR.8.27	And Iesus went out, and his disciples, into the townes of Cesarea Philippi:
b.MAR.8.28	And they answered, Iohn the Baptist: but some say, Elias: &amp; others, one
b.MAR.8.29	And hee saith vnto them, But whom say yee that I am? And Peter answereth and
b.MAR.8.3	And if I send them away fasting to their owne houses, they will faint by the
b.MAR.8.30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
b.MAR.8.31	And hee beganne to teach them, that the Sonne of man must suffer many things,
b.MAR.8.32	And he spake that saying openly. And Peter tooke him, and beganne to rebuke
b.MAR.8.33	But when he had turned about, and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter,
b.MAR.8.34	And when he had called the people vnto him, with his disciples also, he said
b.MAR.8.35	For whosoeuer will saue his life shall lose it, but whosoeuer shall lose his
b.MAR.8.36	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gaine the whole world, and lose
b.MAR.8.37	Or what shall a man giue in exchange for his soule?
b.MAR.8.38	Whosoeuer therefore shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this
b.MAR.8.4	And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfie these men with
b.MAR.8.5	And hee asked them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen.
b.MAR.8.6	And he commanded the people to sit downe on the ground: and he tooke the seuen
b.MAR.8.7	And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commaunded to set them
b.MAR.8.8	So they did eate, and were filled: and they tooke vp, of the broken meate that
b.MAR.8.9	And they that had eaten were about foure thousand, and he sent them away.
b.MAR.9.1	And hee said vnto them, Uerely I say vnto you, that there be some of them that
b.MAR.9.10	And they kept that saying with themselues, questioning one with another, what
b.MAR.9.11	And they asked him, saying, Why say the Scribes that Elias must first come?
b.MAR.9.12	And he answered, and told them, Elias verely commeth first, and restoreth al
b.MAR.9.13	But I say vnto you, that Elias is indeed come, and they haue done vnto him
b.MAR.9.14	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and
b.MAR.9.15	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed,
b.MAR.9.16	And he asked the Scribes, What question ye with them?
b.MAR.9.17	And one of the multitude answered, and said, Master, I haue broughe vnto thee
b.MAR.9.18	And wheresoeuer he taketh him, he teareth him, &amp; he fometh, and gnasheth
b.MAR.9.19	He answereth him, and saith, O faithlesse generation, how long shall I be
b.MAR.9.2	And after sixe dayes, Iesus taketh with him Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and
b.MAR.9.20	And they brought him vnto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit
b.MAR.9.21	And he asked his father, Howe long is it agoe since this came vnto him? And
b.MAR.9.22	And oft times it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters to destroy
b.MAR.9.23	Iesus said vnto him, If thou canst beleeue, all things are possible to him
b.MAR.9.24	And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with teares, Lord,
b.MAR.9.25	When Iesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foule
b.MAR.9.26	And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him, and he was as
b.MAR.9.27	But Iesus tooke him by the hand, and lifted him vp, and he arose.
b.MAR.9.28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him priuately, Why
b.MAR.9.29	And hee said vnto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer,
b.MAR.9.3	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow: so as no Fuller on
b.MAR.9.30	And they departed thence, and passed through
b.MAR.9.31	For he taught his disciples, and said vnto them, The sonne of man is
b.MAR.9.32	But they vnderstood not that saying, and were afraid to aske him.
b.MAR.9.33	And he came to
b.MAR.9.34	But they held their peace: For by the way they had disputed among themselues,
b.MAR.9.35	And he sate downe, and called the twelue, and saith vnto them, If any man
b.MAR.9.36	And he tooke a child, and set him in the midst of them: &amp; when he had
b.MAR.9.37	Whosoeuer shall receiue one of such children in my Name, receiueth me: and
b.MAR.9.38	And Iohn answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out deuils in thy
b.MAR.9.39	But Iesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no man, which shall doe a
b.MAR.9.4	And there appeared vnto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with
b.MAR.9.40	For he that is not against vs, is on our part.
b.MAR.9.41	For whosoeuer shall giue you a cup of water to drinke in my Name, because yee
b.MAR.9.42	And whosoeuer shall offend one of these litle ones that beleeue in me, it is
b.MAR.9.43	And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: It is better for thee to enter into
b.MAR.9.44	Where their worme dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
b.MAR.9.45	And if thy foote offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt
b.MAR.9.46	Where their worme dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
b.MAR.9.47	And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter
b.MAR.9.48	Where their worme dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
b.MAR.9.49	For euery one shall be salted with fire, and euery sacrifice shall be salted
b.MAR.9.5	And Peter answered, and saide to Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to bee here,
b.MAR.9.50	Salt is good: but if the salt haue lost his saltnesse, wherewith will you
b.MAR.9.6	For he wist not what to say, for they were sore afraid.
b.MAR.9.7	And there was a cloud that ouershadowed them: and a voyce came out of the
b.MAR.9.8	And suddenly when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, saue
b.MAR.9.9	And as they came downe from the mountaine, he charged them that they should
b.MAT.10.1	And when hee had called vnto him his twelue disciples, he gaue them power
b.MAT.10.10	Nor scrippe for your iourney, neither two coats, neither shooes, nor yet
b.MAT.10.11	And into whatsoeuer city or towne ye shall enter, inquire who in it is
b.MAT.10.12	And when ye come into an house, salute it.
b.MAT.10.13	And if the house be worthy, let your peace come vpon it: but if it be not
b.MAT.10.14	And whosoeuer shall not receiue you, nor heare your words: when yee depart
b.MAT.10.15	Uerely I say vnto you, it shall be more tolerable for the
b.MAT.10.16	Behold, I send you foorth as sheepe in the middest of wolues: be yee
b.MAT.10.17	But beware of men: for they will deliuer you vp to the Councils, and they
b.MAT.10.18	And yee shall be brought before Gouernours and Kings for my sake, for a
b.MAT.10.19	But when they deliuer you vp, take no thought, how or what ye shall speake,
b.MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelue Apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is
b.MAT.10.20	For it is not yee that speake, but the Spirit of your Father, which speaketh
b.MAT.10.21	And the brother shall deliuer vp the brother to death, and the father the
b.MAT.10.22	And yee shall be hated of all men for my Names sake: but he that endureth to
b.MAT.10.23	But when they persecute you in this citie, flee ye into another: for verely I
b.MAT.10.24	The disciple is not aboue his master, nor the seruant aboue his lord.
b.MAT.10.25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the seruant as
b.MAT.10.26	Feare them not therefore: for there is nothing couered, that shall not be
b.MAT.10.27	What I tell you in darkenesse, that speake yee in light: and what yee heare
b.MAT.10.28	And feare not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soule:
b.MAT.10.29	Are not two Sparrowes solde for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on
b.MAT.10.3	Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the Publicane, Iames the sonne of
b.MAT.10.30	But the very haires of your head are all numbred.
b.MAT.10.31	Feare yee not therefore, ye are of more value then many Sparrowes.
b.MAT.10.32	Whosoeuer therefore shall confesse mee before men, him will I confesse also
b.MAT.10.33	But whosoeuer shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father
b.MAT.10.34	Thinke not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace,
b.MAT.10.35	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, &amp; the daughter
b.MAT.10.36	And a mans foes shalbe they of his owne houshold.
b.MAT.10.37	He that loueth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me: and he
b.MAT.10.38	And he that taketh not his crosse, and followeth after me, is not worthy of
b.MAT.10.39	He that findeth his life, shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my
b.MAT.10.4	Simon the Canaanite, and Iudas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
b.MAT.10.40	He that receiueth you, receiueth me: and he that receiueth mee, receiueth him
b.MAT.10.41	He that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receiue a
b.MAT.10.42	And whosoeuer shall giue to drinke vnto one of these litle ones, a cup of
b.MAT.10.5	These twelue Iesus sent foorth, and commanded them, saying, Goe not into the
b.MAT.10.6	But goe rather to the lost sheepe of the house of
b.MAT.10.7	And as yee goe, preach, saying, The kingdome of heauen is at hand:
b.MAT.10.8	Heale the sicke, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out deuils: freely
b.MAT.10.9	Prouide neither gold, nor siluer, nor brasse in your purses:
b.MAT.1.1	The booke of the generation of Iesus Christ, the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of
b.MAT.1.10	And Ezekias begate Manasses, and Manasses begate Amon, and Amon begate Iosias.
b.MAT.1.11	And Iosias begate Iechonias and his brethren, about the time they were caried
b.MAT.11.1	And it came to passe, when Iesus had made an end of commaunding his twelue
b.MAT.11.10	For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy
b.MAT.11.11	Uerely I say vnto you, Among them that are borne of women, there hath not
b.MAT.11.12	And from the dayes of Iohn the Baptist, vntill now, the kingdome of heauen
b.MAT.11.13	For all the Prophets, and the Law prophecied vntill Iohn.
b.MAT.11.14	And if ye wil receiue it, this is Elias which was for to come.
b.MAT.11.15	Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare.
b.MAT.11.16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like vnto children,
b.MAT.11.17	And saying, we haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not danced: wee haue mourned
b.MAT.11.18	For Iohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, he hath a deuill.
b.MAT.11.19	The sonne of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
b.MAT.1.12	And after they were brought to
b.MAT.11.2	Now when Iohn had heard in the prison the workes of Christ, he sent two of his
b.MAT.11.20	Then began he to vpbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were
b.MAT.11.21	Woe vnto thee Chorazin, woe vnto thee
b.MAT.11.22	But I say vnto you, It shall bee more tolerable for
b.MAT.11.23	And thou
b.MAT.11.24	But I say vnto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the
b.MAT.11.25	At that time Iesus answered, and said, I thanke thee, O Father, Lord of
b.MAT.11.26	Euen so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
b.MAT.11.27	All things are deliuered vnto me of my father: and no man knoweth the sonne
b.MAT.11.28	Come vnto me all yee that labour, and are heauy laden, and I will giue you
b.MAT.11.29	Take my yoke vpon you, and learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly in heart:
b.MAT.1.13	And Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begate Azor.
b.MAT.11.3	And said vnto him, Art thou hee that should come? Or doe wee looke for
b.MAT.11.30	For my yoke is easie, and my burden is light.
b.MAT.1.14	And Azor begat Sadoc, &amp; Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud.
b.MAT.11.4	Iesus answered and saide vnto them, Go and shew Iohn againe those things which
b.MAT.1.15	And Eliud begate Eleazar, and Eleazar begate Matthan, and Matthan begate
b.MAT.11.5	The blind receiue their sight, and the lame walke, the lepers are cleansed,
b.MAT.1.16	And Iacob begate Ioseph the husband of Mary, of whom was borne Iesus, who is
b.MAT.11.6	And blessed is he, whoseouer shal not be offended in me.
b.MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to Dauid, are fourteene generations: and
b.MAT.11.7	And as they departed, Iesus began to say vnto the multitudes concerning Iohn,
b.MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Iesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was
b.MAT.11.8	But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they
b.MAT.1.19	Then Ioseph her husband being a iust man, and not willing to make her a
b.MAT.11.9	But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? yea, I say vnto you, and more then
b.MAT.1.2	Abraham begate Isaac, and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob begate Iudas and his
b.MAT.1.20	But while hee thought on these things, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared
b.MAT.1.21	And she shall bring forth a sonne, and thou shalt call his Name Iesus: for
b.MAT.12.1	At that time, Iesus went on the Sabbath day thorow the corne, &amp; his
b.MAT.12.10	And behold, there was a man which had his hand withered, and they asked him,
b.MAT.12.11	And hee said vnto them, What man shal there be among you, that shall haue one
b.MAT.12.12	How much then is a man better then a shepe? Wherfore it is lawfull to doe
b.MAT.12.13	Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand: and hee stretched it
b.MAT.12.14	Then the Pharises went out, and held a counsell against him, how they might
b.MAT.12.15	But when Iesus knew it, hee withdrew himselfe from thence: and great
b.MAT.12.16	And charged them that they should not make him knowen:
b.MAT.12.17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,
b.MAT.12.18	Behold, my seruant whom I haue chosen, my beloued in whom my soule is well
b.MAT.12.19	He shall not striue, nor cry, neither shall any man heare his voice in the
b.MAT.1.22	(Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
b.MAT.12.2	But when the Pharises saw it, they said vnto him, Behold, thy Disciples doe
b.MAT.12.20	A bruised reed shal he not breake, and smoking flaxe shall he not quench,
b.MAT.12.21	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
b.MAT.12.22	Then was brought vnto him one possessed with a deuill, blinde, and dumbe: and
b.MAT.12.23	And all the people were amazed, and said, Is this the sonne of Dauid?
b.MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doeth not cast out
b.MAT.12.25	And Iesus knew their thoughts, and said vnto them, Euery kingdome diuided
b.MAT.12.26	And if Satan cast out Satan, he is diuided against himselfe; how shall then
b.MAT.12.27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast them
b.MAT.12.28	But if I cast out deuils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdome of God is
b.MAT.12.29	Or else, how can one enter into a strong mans house, &amp; spoile his goods,
b.MAT.1.23	Behold, a Uirgin shall be with childe, and shall bring foorth a sonne, and
b.MAT.12.3	But he said vnto them, Haue yee not read what Dauid did when hee was an
b.MAT.12.30	He that is not with me, is against me: and hee that gathereth not with me,
b.MAT.12.31	Wherefore I say vnto you, All maner of sinne and blasphemie shall be forgiuen
b.MAT.12.32	And whosoeuer speaketh a word against the sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen
b.MAT.12.33	Either make the tree good, and his fruit good: Or else make the tree corrupt,
b.MAT.12.34	O generation of vipers, how can ye, being euil, speake good things? For out
b.MAT.12.35	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth foorth good
b.MAT.12.36	But I say vnto you, That euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall
b.MAT.12.37	For by thy wordes thou shalt bee iustified, and by thy words thou shalt be
b.MAT.12.38	Then certaine of the Scribes, and of the Pharisees, answered, saying, Master,
b.MAT.12.39	But hee answered, and said to them, An euill and adulterous generation
b.MAT.1.24	Then Ioseph, being raised from sleepe, did as the Angel of the Lord had
b.MAT.12.4	How he entred into the house of God, and did eate the shew bread, which was
b.MAT.12.40	For as Ionas was three dayes and three nights in the whales belly: so shal
b.MAT.12.41	The men of Nineue shall rise in iudgement with this generation, and shall
b.MAT.12.42	The Queene of the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation,
b.MAT.12.43	When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, hee walketh thorow dry places,
b.MAT.12.44	Then he saith, I will returne into my house from whence I came out; And when
b.MAT.12.45	Then goeth he, and taketh with himselfe seuen other spirits more wicked then
b.MAT.12.46	While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood
b.MAT.12.47	Then one saide vnto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without,
b.MAT.12.48	But he answered, and said vnto him that told him, Who is my mother? And who
b.MAT.12.49	And hee stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold, my
b.MAT.1.25	And knewe her not, till shee had brought forth her first borne sonne, and he
b.MAT.12.5	Or haue yee not read in the law, how that on the Sabbath dayes the Priests in
b.MAT.12.50	For whosoeuer shall doe the will of my Father which is in heauen, the same is
b.MAT.12.6	But I saye vnto you, that in this place is one greater then the
b.MAT.12.7	But if yee had knowen what this meaneth, I will haue mercy, and not sacrifice,
b.MAT.12.8	For the sonne of man is Lord euen of the Sabbath day.
b.MAT.12.9	And when hee was departed thence, he went into their Synagogue.
b.MAT.1.3	And Iudas begate Phares and Zara of Thamar, and Phares begate Esrom, and Esrom
b.MAT.13.1	The same day went Iesus out of the house, and sate by the sea side.
b.MAT.13.10	And the disciples came, and sayd vnto him, Why speakest thou vnto them in
b.MAT.13.11	He answered, and said vnto them, Because it is giuen vnto you to know the
b.MAT.13.12	For whosoeuer hath, to him shall be giuen, and he shall haue more abundance:
b.MAT.13.13	Therefore speake I to then in parables: because they seeing, see not: and
b.MAT.13.14	And in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye
b.MAT.13.15	For this peoples heart is waxed grosse, and their eares are dull of hearing,
b.MAT.13.16	But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your eares, for they heare.
b.MAT.13.17	For verely I say vnto you, that many Prophets, and righteous men haue desired
b.MAT.13.18	Heare ye therefore the parable of the sower.
b.MAT.13.19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdome, and vnderstandeth it not, then
b.MAT.13.2	And great multitudes were gathered together vnto him, so that hee went into a
b.MAT.13.20	But he that receiued the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth
b.MAT.13.21	Yet hath hee not root in himselfe, but dureth for a while: for when
b.MAT.13.22	He also that receiued seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word, and
b.MAT.13.23	But he that receiued seed into the good ground, is hee that heareth the word,
b.MAT.13.24	Another parable put he forth vnto them, saying; The kingdome of heauen is
b.MAT.13.25	But while men slept, his enemy came &amp; sowed tares among the wheat, and
b.MAT.13.26	But when the blade was sprung vp, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the
b.MAT.13.27	So the seruants of the housholder came, and said vnto him, Sir, didst not
b.MAT.13.28	He said vnto them, An enemy hath done this. The seruants said vnto him, Wilt
b.MAT.13.29	But he said, Nay: lest while yee gather vp the tares, ye root vp also the
b.MAT.13.3	And hee spake many things vnto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went
b.MAT.13.30	Let both grow together vntil the haruest: and in the time of haruest, I will
b.MAT.13.31	Another parable put he foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome of heauen is
b.MAT.13.32	Which indeed is the least of al seeds: but when it is growen, it is the
b.MAT.13.33	Another parable spake he vnto them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto
b.MAT.13.34	All these things spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without a
b.MAT.13.35	That it might bee fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will
b.MAT.13.36	Then Iesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his
b.MAT.13.37	He answered, and said vnto them, Hee that soweth the good seed, is the sonne
b.MAT.13.38	The field is the world. The good seed, are the children of the kingdome: but
b.MAT.13.39	The enemie that sowed them, is the deuill. The haruest, is the ende of the
b.MAT.13.4	And when he sowed, some seedes fell by the wayes side, and the foules came,
b.MAT.13.40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire: so shall it be in
b.MAT.13.41	The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of
b.MAT.13.42	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wayling and
b.MAT.13.43	Then shall the righteous shine foorth as the Sunne, in the kingdome of their
b.MAT.13.44	Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto treasure hid in a field: the
b.MAT.13.45	Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a marchant man, seeking goodly
b.MAT.13.46	Who when hee had found one pearle of great price, he went and solde all that
b.MAT.13.47	Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a net that was cast into the sea,
b.MAT.13.48	Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sate downe, and gathered the
b.MAT.13.49	So shall it be at the ende of the world: the Angels shal come forth, and
b.MAT.13.5	Some fell vpon stony places, where they had not much earth: and foorth with
b.MAT.13.50	And shal cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing, and
b.MAT.13.51	Iesus saith vnto them, Haue ye vnderstood all these things? They say vnto
b.MAT.13.52	Then said he vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is instructed vnto the
b.MAT.13.53	And it came to passe, that when Iesus had finished these parables, hee
b.MAT.13.54	And when hee was come into his owne countrey, he taught them in their
b.MAT.13.55	Is not this the Carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie? and his
b.MAT.13.56	And his sisters, are they not all with vs? whence then hath this man all
b.MAT.13.57	And they were offended in him. But Iesus said vnto them, A Prophet is not
b.MAT.13.58	And hee did not many mighty workes there, because of their vnbeliefe.
b.MAT.13.6	And when the Sunne was vp, they were scorched: and because they had not root,
b.MAT.13.7	And some fell among thorns: and the thornes sprung vp, &amp; choked them.
b.MAT.13.8	But other fell into good ground, and brought foorth fruit, some an hundred
b.MAT.13.9	Who hath eares to heare, let him heare.
b.MAT.1.4	And Aram begate Aminadab, and Aminadab begate Naasson, and Naasson begate
b.MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Iesus,
b.MAT.14.10	And he sent, and beheaded Iohn in the prison.
b.MAT.14.11	And his head was brought in a charger, and giuen to the Damsell: and she
b.MAT.14.12	And his Disciples came, and took vp the body, and buried it, and went and
b.MAT.14.13	When Iesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship, into a desert place
b.MAT.14.14	And Iesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was mooued with
b.MAT.14.15	And when it was euening, his Disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert
b.MAT.14.16	But Iesus said vnto them, They neede not depart; giue yee them to eate.
b.MAT.14.17	And they say vnto him, We haue heere but fiue loaues, and two fishes.
b.MAT.14.18	He said, Bring them hither to me.
b.MAT.14.19	And hee commanded the multitude to sit downe on the grasse, &amp; tooke the
b.MAT.14.2	And said vnto his seruants, This is Iohn the Baptist, hee is risen from the
b.MAT.14.20	And they did all eat, &amp; were filled: and they tooke vp of the fragments
b.MAT.14.21	And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousand men, beside women and
b.MAT.14.22	And straightway Iesus constrained his Disciples to get into a ship, and to
b.MAT.14.23	And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went vp into a mountaine apart
b.MAT.14.24	But the ship was now in the midst of the Sea, tossed with waues: for the wind
b.MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night, Iesus went vnto them, walking on the
b.MAT.14.26	And when the Disciples saw him walking on the Sea, they were troubled,
b.MAT.14.27	But straightway Iesus spake vnto them, saying, Be of good cheere: it is I, be
b.MAT.14.28	And Peter answered him, and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come vnto thee
b.MAT.14.29	And he said, Come. And when Peter was come downe out of the ship, he walked
b.MAT.14.3	For Herode had layd hold on Iohn, and bound him, and put him in prison for
b.MAT.14.30	But when he saw the wind boysterous, he was afraid: and beginning to sinke,
b.MAT.14.31	And immediately Iesus stretched foorth his hand, and caught him, and said
b.MAT.14.32	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
b.MAT.14.33	Then they that were in the ship, came and worshipped him, saying, Of a trueth
b.MAT.14.34	And when they were gone ouer, they came into ye
b.MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all
b.MAT.14.36	And besought him, that they might onely touch the hemme of his garment; and
b.MAT.14.4	For Iohn said vnto him, It is not lawfull for thee to haue her.
b.MAT.14.5	And when he would haue put him to death, hee feared the multitude, because
b.MAT.14.6	But when Herods birth day was kept, the daughter of Herodias daunced before
b.MAT.14.7	Whereupon he promised with an oath, to giue her whatsoeuer she would aske.
b.MAT.14.8	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Giue me heere Iohn
b.MAT.14.9	And the king was sorie: neuerthelesse for the othes sake, and them which sate
b.MAT.1.5	And Salmon begat Boos of Rachab, and Boos begate Obed of Ruth, and Obed begate
b.MAT.15.1	Then came to Iesus Scribes and Pharisees, which were of Hierusalem, saying,
b.MAT.15.10	And he called the multitude, and said vnto them, Heare and vnderstand.
b.MAT.15.11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which commeth
b.MAT.15.12	Then came his disciples, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees
b.MAT.15.13	But he answered and said, Euery plant which my heauenly father hath not
b.MAT.15.14	Let them alone: they be blinde leaders of the blinde. And if the blinde lead
b.MAT.15.15	Then answered Peter, and said vnto him, Declare vnto vs this parable.
b.MAT.15.16	And Iesus said, Are yee also yet without vnderstanding?
b.MAT.15.17	Doe not yee yet vnderstand, that whatsoeuer entreth in at the mouth, goeth
b.MAT.15.18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart,
b.MAT.15.19	For out of the heart proceed euill thoughts, murders, adulteries,
b.MAT.15.2	Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders? for they wash
b.MAT.15.20	These are the things which defile a man: But to eate with vnwashen hands,
b.MAT.15.21	Then Iesus went thence, and departed into the coastes of
b.MAT.15.22	And behold, a woman of
b.MAT.15.23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came, and besought him,
b.MAT.15.24	But he answered, and said, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the
b.MAT.15.25	Then came she, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me.
b.MAT.15.26	But he answered, and said, It is not meete to take the childrens bread, and
b.MAT.15.27	And she said, Trueth Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crummes which fall from
b.MAT.15.28	Then Iesus answered, and said vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it
b.MAT.15.29	And Iesus departed fro thence, and came nigh vnto the
b.MAT.15.3	But hee answered, and said vnto them, Why doe you also transgresse the
b.MAT.15.30	And great multitudes came vnto him, hauing with them those that were lame,
b.MAT.15.31	Insomuch that the multitude wondred, when they saw the dumbe to speake, the
b.MAT.15.32	Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and said, I haue compassion on the
b.MAT.15.33	And his disciples say vnto him, Whence should we haue so much bread in the
b.MAT.15.34	And Iesus saith vnto them, How many loaues haue yee? And they said, Seuen,
b.MAT.15.35	And hee commaunded the multitude to sit downe on the ground.
b.MAT.15.36	And he tooke the seuen loaues and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake
b.MAT.15.37	And they did all eate, and were filled: and they tooke vp of the broken meate
b.MAT.15.38	And they that did eat, were foure thousand men, beside women and children.
b.MAT.15.39	And he sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the coasts of
b.MAT.15.4	For God commaunded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: And hee that curseth
b.MAT.15.5	But yee say, Whosoeuer shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift by
b.MAT.15.6	And honour not his father or his mother, hee shall be free. Thus haue yee made
b.MAT.15.7	Yee hypocrites, well did Esaias prophecie of you, saying,
b.MAT.15.8	This people draweth nigh vnto mee with their mouth, and honoureth mee with
b.MAT.15.9	But in vaine they do worship me, teaching for doctrines, the commandements of
b.MAT.1.6	And Iesse begate Dauid the King, &amp; Dauid the King begat Solomon of her
b.MAT.16.1	The Pharises also, with the Sadduces, came, and tempting, desired him that hee
b.MAT.16.10	Neither the seuen loaues of the foure thousand, and how many baskets ye tooke
b.MAT.16.11	How is it that ye doe not vnderstand, that I spake it not to you concerning
b.MAT.16.12	Then vnderstood they how that he bade them not beware of the leauen of bread:
b.MAT.16.13	When Iesus came into the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
b.MAT.16.14	And they said, Some say that thou art Iohn the Baptist, some Elias, and
b.MAT.16.15	He saith vnto them, But whom say ye that I am?
b.MAT.16.16	And Simon Peter answered, and said, Thou art Christ the sonne of the liuing
b.MAT.16.17	And Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Blessed art thou Simon Bar Iona: for
b.MAT.16.18	And I say also vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will
b.MAT.16.19	And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen: and whatsoeuer
b.MAT.16.2	He answered, and said vnto them, When it is euening, yee say, It will bee
b.MAT.16.20	Then charged hee his disciples that they should tel no man that he was Iesus
b.MAT.16.21	From that time foorth began Iesus to shew vnto his disciples, how that he
b.MAT.16.22	Then Peter tooke him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it farre from thee
b.MAT.16.23	But he turned, and said vnto Peter, Get thee behind mee, Satan, thou art an
b.MAT.16.24	Then said Iesus vnto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him
b.MAT.16.25	For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer will lose his
b.MAT.16.26	For what is a man profited, if hee shal gaine the whole world, and lose his
b.MAT.16.27	For the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father, with his Angels:
b.MAT.16.28	Uerely I say vnto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of
b.MAT.16.3	And in the morning, It will be foule weather to day: for the skie is red and
b.MAT.16.4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a signe, and there shall no
b.MAT.16.5	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take
b.MAT.16.6	Then Iesus said vnto them, Take heed and beware of the leauen of the Pharises,
b.MAT.16.7	And they reasoned among themselues, saying, It is because we haue taken no
b.MAT.16.8	Which when Iesus perceiued, he said vnto them, O ye of little faith, why
b.MAT.16.9	Doe ye not yet vnderstand, neither remember the fiue loaues of the fiue
b.MAT.1.7	And Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begate Abia, and Abia begate Asa.
b.MAT.17.1	And after sixe dayes, Iesus taketh Peter, Iames, and Iohn his brother, and
b.MAT.17.10	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the Scribes that Elias must
b.MAT.17.11	And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Elias truely shall first come, and
b.MAT.17.12	But I say vnto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but
b.MAT.17.13	Then the Disciples vnderstood that he spake vnto them of Iohn the Baptist.
b.MAT.17.14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certaine man,
b.MAT.17.15	Lord, haue mercie on my sonne, for he is lunatike, and sore vexed: for oft
b.MAT.17.16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
b.MAT.17.17	Then Iesus answered, and said, O faithlesse and peruerse generation, how long
b.MAT.17.18	And Iesus rebuked the deuill, and hee departed out of him: and the childe was
b.MAT.17.19	Then came the Disciples to Iesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him
b.MAT.17.2	And was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the Sunne, and his
b.MAT.17.20	And Iesus said vnto them, Because of your vnbeliefe: for verily I say vnto
b.MAT.17.21	Howbeit, this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.
b.MAT.17.22	And while they abode in
b.MAT.17.23	And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised againe: And
b.MAT.17.24	And when they were come to
b.MAT.17.25	Hee saith, Yes. And when hee was come into the house, Iesus preuented him,
b.MAT.17.26	Peter saith vnto him, Of strangers. Iesus saith vnto him, Then are the
b.MAT.17.27	Notwithstanding, least we should offend them, goe thou to the Sea, and cast
b.MAT.17.3	And behold, there appeared vnto them Moses, and Elias, talking with him.
b.MAT.17.4	Then answered Peter, and saide vnto Iesus, Lord, it is good for vs to be here:
b.MAT.17.5	While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud ouershadowed them: and behold a
b.MAT.17.6	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore
b.MAT.17.7	And Iesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
b.MAT.17.8	And when they had lift vp their eyes, they saw no man, saue Iesus only.
b.MAT.17.9	And as they came downe from the mountaine, Iesus charged them, saying, Tell
b.MAT.1.8	And Asa begate Iosaphat, and Iosaphat begate Ioram, and Ioram begate Ozias.
b.MAT.18.1	At the same time came the Disciples vnto Iesus, saying, Who is the greatest in
b.MAT.18.10	Take heed that yee despise not one of these little ones: for I say vnto you,
b.MAT.18.11	For the sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost.
b.MAT.18.12	How thinke yee? If a man haue an hundred sheepe, and one of them be gone
b.MAT.18.13	And if so be that he find it, Uerily I say vnto you, hee reioyceth more of
b.MAT.18.14	Euen so, it is not the will of your father which is in heauen, that one of
b.MAT.18.15	Moreouer, if thy brother shall trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his
b.MAT.18.16	But if he will not heare thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in
b.MAT.18.17	And if hee shall neglect to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: But if he
b.MAT.18.18	Uerily I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer ye shall binde on earth, shall bee bound in
b.MAT.18.19	Againe I say vnto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching
b.MAT.18.2	And Iesus called a little child vnto him, and set him in the midst of them,
b.MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the
b.MAT.18.21	Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sinne
b.MAT.18.22	Iesus saith vnto him, I say not vnto thee, Untill seuen times: but, Untill
b.MAT.18.23	Therefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine king, which would
b.MAT.18.24	And when hee had begun to reckon, one was brought vnto him which ought him
b.MAT.18.25	But forasmuch as hee had not to pay, his lord commanded him to bee sold, and
b.MAT.18.26	The seruant therfore fell downe, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, haue
b.MAT.18.27	Then the Lord of that seruant was moued with compassion, and loosed him, and
b.MAT.18.28	But the same seruant went out, and found one of his fellow-seruants, which
b.MAT.18.29	And his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete, and besought him, saying,
b.MAT.18.3	And said, Uerily I say vnto you, Except yee be conuerted, and become as little
b.MAT.18.30	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till hee should pay the
b.MAT.18.31	So when his fellow-seruants saw what was done, they were very sorie, and
b.MAT.18.32	Then his lord, after that hee had called him, said vnto him, O thou wicked
b.MAT.18.33	Shouldest not thou also haue had compassion on thy fellow-seruant, euen as I
b.MAT.18.34	And his lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentors, till hee should
b.MAT.18.35	So likewise shall my heauenly Father doe also vnto you, if yee from your
b.MAT.18.4	Whosoeuer therefore shall humble himselfe as this little childe, the same is
b.MAT.18.5	And who so shall receiue one such little child in my name, receiueth me.
b.MAT.18.6	But who so shall offend one of these little ones which beleeue in me, it were
b.MAT.18.7	Woe vnto the world because of offences: for it must needs be that offences
b.MAT.18.8	Wherefore if thy hand or thy foote offend thee, cut them off, and cast them
b.MAT.18.9	And if thine eie offend thee, plucke it out, and cast it from thee: it is
b.MAT.1.9	And Ozias begat Ioatham, and Ioatham begate Achas, and Achas begate Ezekias.
b.MAT.19.1	And it came to passe, that when Iesus had finished these sayings, he departed
b.MAT.19.10	His disciples say vnto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is
b.MAT.19.11	But hee said vnto them, All men cannot receiue this saying, saue they to whom
b.MAT.19.12	For there are some Eunuches, which were so borne from their mothers wombe:
b.MAT.19.13	Then were there brought vnto him little children, that he should put his
b.MAT.19.14	But Iesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come vnto me:
b.MAT.19.15	And he laide his hands on them, and departed thence.
b.MAT.19.16	And behold, one came and said vnto him, Good master, what good thing shall I
b.MAT.19.17	And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one,
b.MAT.19.18	He saith vnto him, Which? Iesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not
b.MAT.19.19	Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy
b.MAT.19.2	And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
b.MAT.19.20	The young man saith vnto him, All these things haue I kept from my youth vp:
b.MAT.19.21	Iesus said vnto him, If thou wilt be perfect, goe and sell that thou hast,
b.MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowfull: for he had
b.MAT.19.23	Then said Iesus vnto his disciples, Uerely I say vnto you, that a rich man
b.MAT.19.24	And againe I say vnto you, It is easier for a camel to goe thorow the eye of
b.MAT.19.25	When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then
b.MAT.19.26	But Iesus beheld them, and said vnto them, With men this is vnpossible, but
b.MAT.19.27	Then answered Peter, and said vnto him, Behold, we haue forsaken all, and
b.MAT.19.28	And Iesus said vnto them, Uerily I say vnto you, that ye which haue followed
b.MAT.19.29	And euery one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
b.MAT.19.3	The Pharisees also came vnto him, tempting him, and saying vnto him, Is it
b.MAT.19.30	But many that are first, shall be last, and the last shall be first.
b.MAT.19.4	And hee answered, and said vnto them, Haue ye not read, that he which made
b.MAT.19.5	And said, For this cause shall a man leaue father and mother, and shall cleaue
b.MAT.19.6	Wherefore they are no more twaine, but one flesh. What therefore God hath
b.MAT.19.7	They say vnto him, Why did Moses then command to giue a writing of diuorcement,
b.MAT.19.8	Hee saith vnto them, Moses, because of the hardnesse of your hearts, suffered
b.MAT.19.9	And I say vnto you, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, except it be for
b.MAT.20.1	For the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a man that is an housholder, which
b.MAT.20.10	But when the first came, they supposed that they should haue receiued more,
b.MAT.20.11	And when they had receiued it, they murmured against the good man of the
b.MAT.20.12	Saying, These last haue wrought but one houre, and thou hast made them equall
b.MAT.20.13	But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not
b.MAT.20.14	Take that thine is, and goe thy way, I will giue vnto this last, euen as vnto
b.MAT.20.15	Is it not lawfull for mee to doe what I wil with mine owne? Is thine eye
b.MAT.20.16	So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many bee called, but fewe
b.MAT.20.17	And Iesus going vp to Hierusalem, tooke the twelue disciples apart in the
b.MAT.20.18	Behold, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall be betraied vnto
b.MAT.20.19	And shal deliuer him to the Gentiles to mocke, and to scourge, and to
b.MAT.20.2	And when hee had agreed with the labourers for a peny a day, he sent them into
b.MAT.20.20	Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children, with her sonnes,
b.MAT.20.21	And he said vnto her, What wilt thou? She saith vnto him, Grant, that these
b.MAT.20.22	But Iesus answered, and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke
b.MAT.20.23	And he saith vnto them, Yee shall drinke indeed of my cup, and be baptized
b.MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard it, they were moued with indignation against the two
b.MAT.20.25	But Iesus called them vnto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the
b.MAT.20.26	But it shall not be so among you: But whosoeuer will bee great among you, let
b.MAT.20.27	And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.
b.MAT.20.28	Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto, but minister, and to
b.MAT.20.29	And as they departed from Hiericho, a great multitude followed him.
b.MAT.20.3	And he went out about the third houre, and saw others standing idle in the
b.MAT.20.30	And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Iesus
b.MAT.20.31	And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but
b.MAT.20.32	And Iesus stood still, and called them, and saide, What will yee that I shall
b.MAT.20.33	They say vnto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
b.MAT.20.34	So Iesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediatly their
b.MAT.20.4	And said vnto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, &amp; whatsoeuer is right, I
b.MAT.20.5	Againe he went out about the sixth and ninth houre, and did likewise.
b.MAT.20.6	And about the eleuenth houre, he went out, and found others standing idle, and
b.MAT.20.7	They say vnto him, Because no man hath hired vs. He saith vnto them, Go ye
b.MAT.20.8	So when euen was come, the lord of the vineyard saith vnto his Steward, Call
b.MAT.20.9	And when they came that were hired about the eleuenth houre, they receiued
b.MAT.2.1	Now when Iesus was borne in Bethlehem of Iudea, in the dayes of Herod the
b.MAT.2.10	When they saw the Starre, they reioyced with exceeding great ioy.
b.MAT.2.11	And when they were come into the house, they saw the yong child with Mary his
b.MAT.21.1	And when they drewe nigh vnto Hierusalem, and were come to Bethphage, vnto the
b.MAT.21.10	And when hee was come into Hierusalem, all the citie was mooued, saying, Who
b.MAT.21.11	And the multitude said, This is Iesus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
b.MAT.21.12	And Iesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and
b.MAT.21.13	And said vnto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of
b.MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the
b.MAT.21.15	And when the chiefe Priests and Scribes saw the wonderfull things that he
b.MAT.21.16	And said vnto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Iesus saith vnto them,
b.MAT.21.17	And he left them, and went out of the citie into
b.MAT.21.18	Now in the morning, as hee returned into the citie, he hungred.
b.MAT.21.19	And when he saw a figge tree in the way, hee came to it, and found nothing
b.MAT.2.12	And being warned of God in a dreame, that they should not returne to Herode,
b.MAT.21.2	Saying vnto them, Goe into the village ouer against you, and straightway yee
b.MAT.21.20	And when the Disciples saw it, they marueiled, saying, How soone is the figge
b.MAT.21.21	Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Uerily I say vnto you, if yee haue faith,
b.MAT.21.22	And all things whatsoeuer yee shall aske in prayer, beleeuing, ye shall
b.MAT.21.23	And when he was come into the temple, the chiefe Priests and the Elders of
b.MAT.21.24	And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, I also will aske you one thing, which
b.MAT.21.25	The baptisme of Iohn, whence was it? from heauen, or of men? and they
b.MAT.21.26	But if we shall say, Of men, we feare the people, for all hold Iohn as a
b.MAT.21.27	And they answered Iesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said vnto them,
b.MAT.21.28	But what thinke you? A certaine man had two sonnes, and he came to the first,
b.MAT.21.29	He answered, &amp; said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
b.MAT.2.13	And when they were departed, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeareth to
b.MAT.21.3	And if any man say ought vnto you, yee shall say, The Lord hath need of them,
b.MAT.21.30	And hee came to the second, and said likewise: and hee answered, and said, I
b.MAT.21.31	Whether of them twaine did the will of his father? They say vnto him, The
b.MAT.21.32	For Iohn came vnto you in the way of righteousnesse, and ye beleeued him not:
b.MAT.21.33	Heare another parable. There was a certaine house-holder, which planted a
b.MAT.21.34	And when the time of the fruite drew neere, he sent his seruants to the
b.MAT.21.35	And the husbandmen tooke his seruants, and beat one, and killed another, and
b.MAT.21.36	Againe hee sent other seruants, moe then the first, and they did vnto them
b.MAT.21.37	But last of all, he sent vnto them his sonne, saying, They will reuerence my
b.MAT.21.38	But when the husbandmen saw the sonne, they said among themselues, This is
b.MAT.21.39	And they caught him, and cast him out of the Uineyard, and slew him.
b.MAT.2.14	When he arose, he tooke the yong childe and his mother by night, and departed
b.MAT.21.4	All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet,
b.MAT.21.40	When the Lord therefore of the Uineyard commeth, what will he doe vnto those
b.MAT.21.41	They say vnto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let
b.MAT.21.42	Iesus saith vnto them, Did ye neuer reade in the Scriptures, The stone which
b.MAT.21.43	Therefore say I vnto you, the kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and
b.MAT.21.44	And whosoeuer shall fall on this stone, shalbe broken: but on whom soeuer it
b.MAT.21.45	And when the chiefe Priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they
b.MAT.21.46	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because
b.MAT.2.15	And was there vntill the death of Herode, that it might be fulfilled which
b.MAT.21.5	Tell yee the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy king commeth vnto thee, meeke, and
b.MAT.2.16	Then Herode, when hee saw that hee was mocked of the Wise men, was exceeding
b.MAT.21.6	And the Disciples went, and did as Iesus commanded them,
b.MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremie the Prophet, saying,
b.MAT.21.7	And brought the Asse, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they
b.MAT.2.18	In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great
b.MAT.21.8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way, others cut downe
b.MAT.2.19	But when Herode was dead, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a dreame
b.MAT.21.9	And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna
b.MAT.2.2	Saying, Where is he that is borne King of the Iewes? for we haue seene his
b.MAT.2.20	Saying, Arise, and take the yong childe and his mother, and goe into the
b.MAT.2.21	And he arose, and tooke the yong childe and his mother, and came into the
b.MAT.22.1	And Iesus answered, and spake vnto them againe by parables, and said,
b.MAT.22.10	So those seruants went out into the high wayes, and gathered together all as
b.MAT.22.11	And when the King came in to see the guests, hee sawe there a man, which had
b.MAT.22.12	And hee sayth vnto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not hauing a
b.MAT.22.13	Then said the king to the seruants, Binde him hand and foot, and take him
b.MAT.22.14	For many are called, but few are chosen.
b.MAT.22.15	Then went the Pharises, and tooke counsell, how they might intangle him in
b.MAT.22.16	And they sent out vnto him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying,
b.MAT.22.17	Tell vs therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto
b.MAT.22.18	But Iesus perceiued their wickednesse, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye
b.MAT.22.19	Shew me the tribute money. And they brought vnto him a peny.
b.MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in the roome of his
b.MAT.22.2	The Kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King, which made a marriage for
b.MAT.22.20	And he sayth vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
b.MAT.22.21	They say vnto him, Cesars. Then sayth he vnto them, Render therefore vnto
b.MAT.22.22	When they had heard these wordes, they marueiled, and left him, and went
b.MAT.22.23	The same day came to him the Sadduces, which say that there is no
b.MAT.22.24	Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, hauing no children, his brother
b.MAT.22.25	Now there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first when he had maried a
b.MAT.22.26	Likewise the second also, and the third, vnto the seuenth.
b.MAT.22.27	And last of al the woman died also.
b.MAT.22.28	Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? for
b.MAT.22.29	Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Yee doe erre, not knowing the Scriptures,
b.MAT.2.23	And hee came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled
b.MAT.22.3	And sent forth his seruants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and
b.MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are giuen in marriage, but
b.MAT.22.31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read that which was
b.MAT.22.32	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is
b.MAT.22.33	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
b.MAT.22.34	But when the Pharises had heard that he had put the Sadduces to silence, they
b.MAT.22.35	Then one of them, which was a Lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and
b.MAT.22.36	Master, which is the great Commandement in the Law?
b.MAT.22.37	Iesus sayd vnto him, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
b.MAT.22.38	This is the first and great Commandement.
b.MAT.22.39	And the second is like vnto it, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.
b.MAT.22.4	Againe, hee sent foorth other seruants, saying, Tell them which are bidden,
b.MAT.22.40	On these two Commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets.
b.MAT.22.41	While the Pharises were gathered together, Iesus asked them,
b.MAT.22.42	Saying, What thinke yee of Christ? whose sonne is hee? They say vnto him, The
b.MAT.22.43	He saith vnto them, How then doth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying,
b.MAT.22.44	The Lord said vnto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine
b.MAT.22.45	If Dauid then call him Lord, how is he his sonne?
b.MAT.22.46	And no man was able to answere him a word, neither durst any man (from that
b.MAT.22.5	But they made light of it, and went their wayes, one to his farme, another to
b.MAT.22.6	And the remnant tooke his seruants, and intreated them spitefully, and slew
b.MAT.22.7	But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth, and hee sent foorth his armies,
b.MAT.22.8	Then saith hee to his seruants, The wedding is ready, but they which were
b.MAT.22.9	Goe yee therefore into the high wayes, and as many as yee shall finde, bid to
b.MAT.2.3	When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all
b.MAT.23.1	Then spake Iesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
b.MAT.23.10	Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, euen Christ.
b.MAT.23.11	But hee that is greatest among you, shall be your seruant.
b.MAT.23.12	And whosoeuer shall exalt himselfe, shall be abased: and he that shall humble
b.MAT.23.13	But woe vnto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee shut vp the
b.MAT.23.14	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee deuoure widowes
b.MAT.23.15	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites; for yee
b.MAT.23.16	Woe vnto you, yee blind guides, which say, Whosoeuer shall sweare by the
b.MAT.23.17	Ye fooles and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the
b.MAT.23.18	And whosoeuer shall sweare by the Altar, it is nothing: but whosoeuer
b.MAT.23.19	Ye fooles and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the Altar that
b.MAT.23.2	Saying, The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate:
b.MAT.23.20	Who so therefore shall sweare by the Altar, sweareth by it, and by all things
b.MAT.23.21	And who so shall sweare by the
b.MAT.23.22	And he that shall sweare by heauen, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him
b.MAT.23.23	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee pay tithe of mint,
b.MAT.23.24	Ye blind guides, which straine at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
b.MAT.23.25	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites; for yee make cleane the
b.MAT.23.26	Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter,
b.MAT.23.27	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for yee are like vnto whited
b.MAT.23.28	Euen so, yee also outwardly appeare righteous vnto men, but within ye are
b.MAT.23.29	Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye build the tombes
b.MAT.23.3	All therefore whatsoeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue and doe, but doe
b.MAT.23.30	And say, If wee had beene in the dayes of our fathers, wee would not haue
b.MAT.23.31	Wherefore ye bee witnesses vnto your selues, that yee are the children of
b.MAT.23.32	Fil ye vp then the measure of your fathers.
b.MAT.23.33	Yee serpents, yee generation of vipers, How can yee escape the damnation of
b.MAT.23.34	Wherefore behold, I send vnto you Prophets, and wisemen, and Scribes, and
b.MAT.23.35	That vpon you may come all the righteous blood shed vpon the earth, from the
b.MAT.23.36	Uerily I say vnto you, All these things shal come vpon this generation.
b.MAT.23.37	O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them
b.MAT.23.38	Behold, your house is left vnto you desolate.
b.MAT.23.39	For I say vnto you, yee shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say,
b.MAT.23.4	For they binde heauie burdens, and grieuous to be borne, and lay them on mens
b.MAT.23.5	But all their workes they doe, for to be seene of men: they make broad their
b.MAT.23.6	And loue the vppermost roomes at feasts, and the chiefe seats in the
b.MAT.23.7	And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
b.MAT.23.8	But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, euen Christ, and all ye
b.MAT.23.9	And call no man your father vpon the earth: for one is your father which is in
b.MAT.2.4	And when he had gathered all the chiefe Priests and Scribes of the people
b.MAT.24.1	And Iesus went out, and departed from the temple, and his Disciples came to
b.MAT.24.10	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate
b.MAT.24.11	And many false Prophets shall rise, and shall deceiue many.
b.MAT.24.12	And because iniquitie shal abound, the loue of many shall waxe cold.
b.MAT.24.13	But he that shall endure vnto the end, the same shall be saued.
b.MAT.24.14	And this Gospell of the kingdome shall be preached in all the world, for a
b.MAT.24.15	When yee therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by
b.MAT.24.16	Then let them which be in Iudea, flee into the mountaines.
b.MAT.24.17	Let him which is on the house top, not come downe, to take any thing out of
b.MAT.24.18	Neither let him which is in the field, returne backe to take his clothes.
b.MAT.24.19	And woe vnto them that are with child, and to them that giue sucke in those
b.MAT.24.2	And Iesus said vnto them, See yee not all these things? Uerily I say vnto you,
b.MAT.24.20	But pray yee that your flight bee not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath
b.MAT.24.21	For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of
b.MAT.24.22	And except those dayes should be shortned, there should no flesh be saued:
b.MAT.24.23	Then if any man shall say vnto you, Loe, heere is Christ, or there: beleeue
b.MAT.24.24	For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shal shew great
b.MAT.24.25	Behold, I haue told you before.
b.MAT.24.26	Wherefore, if they shall say vnto you, Behold, he is in the desert, goe not
b.MAT.24.27	For as the lightening commeth out of the East, and shineth euen vnto the
b.MAT.24.28	For wheresoeuer the carkeise is, there will the Eagles bee gathered together.
b.MAT.24.29	Immediately after the tribulation of those dayes, shall the Sunne be darkned,
b.MAT.24.3	And as he sate vpon the mount of Oliues, the Disciples came vnto him priuately,
b.MAT.24.30	And then shall appeare the signe of the Sonne of man in heauen: and then
b.MAT.24.31	And hee shall send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall
b.MAT.24.32	Now learne a parable of the figtree: when his branch is yet tender, and
b.MAT.24.33	So likewise yee, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is neere,
b.MAT.24.34	Uerely I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe, till all these things
b.MAT.24.35	Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my wordes shall not passe away.
b.MAT.24.36	But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no, not the Angels of heauen, but
b.MAT.24.37	But as the dayes of Noe were, so shall also the comming of the Sonne of man
b.MAT.24.38	For as in the dayes that were before the Flood, they were eating, and
b.MAT.24.39	And knew not vntill the Flood came, and tooke them all away: so shall also
b.MAT.24.4	And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Take heed that no man deceiue you.
b.MAT.24.40	Then shall two be in the field, the one shalbe taken, and the other left.
b.MAT.24.41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill: the one shall be taken, and the
b.MAT.24.42	Watch therfore, for ye know not what houre your Lord doth come.
b.MAT.24.43	But know this, that if the good man of the house had knowen in what watch the
b.MAT.24.44	Therefore be yee also ready: for in such an houre as you thinke not, the
b.MAT.24.45	Who then is a faithfull and wise seruant, whom his Lord hath made ruler ouer
b.MAT.24.46	Blessed is that seruant, whome his Lord when he commeth, shall finde so
b.MAT.24.47	Uerely I say vnto you, that hee shal make him ruler ouer all his goods.
b.MAT.24.48	But and if that euill seruant shal say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his
b.MAT.24.49	And shall begin to smite his fellow seruants, and to eate and drinke with the
b.MAT.24.5	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall deceiue many.
b.MAT.24.50	The Lord of that seruant shall come in a day when hee looketh not for him,
b.MAT.24.51	And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites:
b.MAT.24.6	And yee shall heare of warres, and rumors of warres: See that yee be not
b.MAT.24.7	For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome, and there
b.MAT.24.8	All these are the beginning of sorrowes.
b.MAT.24.9	Then shall they deliuer you vp to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and yee
b.MAT.2.5	And they said vnto him, In Bethlehem of Iudea: For thus it is written by the
b.MAT.25.1	Then shall the kingdome of heauen be likened vnto ten Uirgins, which tooke
b.MAT.25.10	And while they went to buy, the bridegrome came, and they that were ready,
b.MAT.25.11	Afterward came also the other virgines, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs.
b.MAT.25.12	But he answered, and said, Uerely I say vnto you, I know you not.
b.MAT.25.13	Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day, nor the houre, wherein the
b.MAT.25.14	For the kingdome of heauen is as a man trauailing into a farre countrey, who
b.MAT.25.15	And vnto one he gaue fiue talents, to another two, and to another one, to
b.MAT.25.16	Then hee that had receiued the fiue talents, went and traded with the same,
b.MAT.25.17	And likewise he that had receiued two, he also gained other two.
b.MAT.25.18	But hee that had receiued one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his
b.MAT.25.19	After a long time, the lord of those seruants commeth, and reckoneth with
b.MAT.25.2	And fiue of them were wise, and fiue were foolish.
b.MAT.25.20	And so hee that had receiued fiue talents, came and brought other fiue
b.MAT.25.21	His lord said vnto him, Well done, thou good and faithfull seruant, thou hast
b.MAT.25.22	He also that had receiued two talents, came and said, Lord, thou deliueredst
b.MAT.25.23	His lord said vnto him, Well done, good and faithfull seruant, thou hast
b.MAT.25.24	Then he which had receiued the one talent, came &amp; said, Lord, I knew thee
b.MAT.25.25	And I was afraid, and went and hidde thy talent in the earth: loe, there thou
b.MAT.25.26	His lord answered, and said vnto him, Thou wicked and slouthfull seruant,
b.MAT.25.27	Thou oughtest therefore to haue put my money to the exchangers, and then at
b.MAT.25.28	Take therefore the talent from him, and giue it vnto him which hath ten
b.MAT.25.29	For vnto euery one that hath shall be giuen, and he shall haue abundance: but
b.MAT.25.3	They that were foolish tooke their lampes, and tooke no oyle with them:
b.MAT.25.30	And cast yee the vnprofitable seruant into outer darkenesse, there shall be
b.MAT.25.31	When the Sonne of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with
b.MAT.25.32	And before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate them one
b.MAT.25.33	And he shall set the sheepe on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
b.MAT.25.34	Then shall the King say vnto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my
b.MAT.25.35	For I was an hungred, and yee gaue me meate: I was thirstie, and ye gaue me
b.MAT.25.36	Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sicke, and yee visited me: I was in prison,
b.MAT.25.37	Then shal the righteous answere him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
b.MAT.25.38	When saw wee thee a stranger, and tooke thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
b.MAT.25.39	Or when saw we thee sicke, or in prison, and came vnto thee?
b.MAT.25.4	But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their lampes.
b.MAT.25.40	And the King shall answere, and say vnto them, Uerely I say vnto you, in as
b.MAT.25.41	Then shall he say also vnto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed,
b.MAT.25.42	For I was an hungred, and yee gaue me no meat: I was thirstie, and ye gaue me
b.MAT.25.43	I was a stranger, and yee tooke me not in: naked, and ye clothed mee not:
b.MAT.25.44	Then shall they also answere him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred,
b.MAT.25.45	Then shall he answere them, saying, Uerely, I say vnto you, in as much as ye
b.MAT.25.46	And these shall goe away into euerlasting punishment: but the righteous into
b.MAT.25.5	While the bridegrome taried, they all slumbred and slept.
b.MAT.25.6	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegrome commeth, goe ye
b.MAT.25.7	Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lampes.
b.MAT.25.8	And the foolish said vnto the wise, Giue vs of your oyle, for our lampes are
b.MAT.25.9	But the wise answered, saying, Not so, lest there be not ynough for vs and
b.MAT.2.6	And thou
b.MAT.26.1	And it came to passe, when Iesus had finished al these sayings, hee said vnto
b.MAT.26.10	When Iesus vnderstood it, he said vnto them, Why trouble ye the woman? For
b.MAT.26.11	For ye haue the poore alwayes with you, but me ye haue not alwayes.
b.MAT.26.12	For in that she hath powred this ointment on my body, shee did it for my
b.MAT.26.13	Uerely I say vnto you, Wheresoeuer this Gospel shall be preached in the whole
b.MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelue, called Iudas Iscariot, went vnto the chiefe Priests,
b.MAT.26.15	And said vnto them, What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you?
b.MAT.26.16	And from that time he sought opportunitie to betray him.
b.MAT.26.17	Now the first day of the feast of vnleauened bread, the disciples came to
b.MAT.26.18	And he said, Goe into the citie to such a man, and say vnto him, The Master
b.MAT.26.19	And the disciples did, as Iesus had appointed them, and they made ready the
b.MAT.26.2	Ye know that after two dayes is the feast of the Passeouer, and the Sonne of
b.MAT.26.20	Now when the euen was come, he sate downe with the twelue.
b.MAT.26.21	And as they did eate, he said, Uerely I say vnto you, that one of you shal
b.MAT.26.22	And they were exceeding sorowfull, and began euery one of them to say vnto
b.MAT.26.23	And he answered and said, Hee that dippeth his hand with mee in the dish, the
b.MAT.26.24	The sonne of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe vnto that man by whom
b.MAT.26.25	Then Iudas, which betrayed him, answered, and said, Master, Is it I? He said
b.MAT.26.26	And as they were eating, Iesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and
b.MAT.26.27	And he tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and gaue it to them, saying, Drinke
b.MAT.26.28	For this is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed for many for the
b.MAT.26.29	But I say vnto you, I will not drinke henceforth of this fruite of the vine,
b.MAT.26.3	Then assembled together the chiefe Priests, and the Scribes, and the Elders of
b.MAT.26.30	And when they had sung an hymne, they went out into the mount of Oliues.
b.MAT.26.31	Then saith Iesus vnto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this
b.MAT.26.32	But after I am risen againe, I will goe before you into
b.MAT.26.33	Peter answered, and said vnto him, Though all men shall be offended because
b.MAT.26.34	Iesus said vnto him, Uerily I say vnto thee, that this might before the cocke
b.MAT.26.35	Peter said vnto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not denie
b.MAT.26.36	Then commeth Iesus with them vnto a place called
b.MAT.26.37	And hee tooke with him Peter, and the two sonnes of Zebedee, and beganne to
b.MAT.26.38	Then saith he vnto them, My soule is exceeding sorrowfull, euen vnto death:
b.MAT.26.39	And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my
b.MAT.26.4	And consulted that they might take Iesus by subtiltie, and kill him.
b.MAT.26.40	And he commeth vnto the Disciples, and findeth them asleepe, and saith vnto
b.MAT.26.41	Watch and pray, that yee enter not into temptation: The spirit indeed is
b.MAT.26.42	He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my father, if this
b.MAT.26.43	And he came and found them asleep againe: For their eies were heauie.
b.MAT.26.44	And he left them, and went away againe, and prayed the third time, saying the
b.MAT.26.45	Then commeth he to his Disciples, and saith vnto them, Sleepe on now, and
b.MAT.26.46	Rise, let vs be going: behold, he is at hand that doeth betray me.
b.MAT.26.47	And while yet spake, loe, Iudas one of the twelue came, and with him a great
b.MAT.26.48	Now he that betrayed him, gaue them a signe, saying, Whomsoeuer I shall kisse,
b.MAT.26.49	And forthwith hee came to Iesus, and said, Haile master, and kissed him.
b.MAT.26.5	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there bee an vproare among the
b.MAT.26.50	And Iesus said vnto him, Friend, Wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and
b.MAT.26.51	And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hand, and
b.MAT.26.52	Then said Iesus vnto him, Put vp againe thy sword into his place: for all
b.MAT.26.53	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my father, and he shall presently
b.MAT.26.54	But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
b.MAT.26.55	In that same houre said Iesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a
b.MAT.26.56	But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be
b.MAT.26.57	And they that had laid hold on Iesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high
b.MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him afarre off, vnto the high Priests palace, and went in,
b.MAT.26.59	Now the chiefe Priests and Elders, and all the councell, sought false
b.MAT.26.6	Now when Iesus was in Bethanie, in the house of Simon the leper,
b.MAT.26.60	But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none.
b.MAT.26.61	And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the
b.MAT.26.62	And the high Priest arose, and said vnto him, Answerest thou nothing? What is
b.MAT.26.63	But Iesus held his peace. And the high Priest answered, and said vnto him, I
b.MAT.26.64	Iesus saith vnto him, Thou hast saide: Neuerthelesse I say vnto you,
b.MAT.26.65	Then the high Priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemie:
b.MAT.26.66	What thinke ye? They answered and said, He is guiltie of death.
b.MAT.26.67	Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and others smote him with
b.MAT.26.68	Saying, Prophecie vnto vs, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?
b.MAT.26.69	Now Peter sate without in the palace: and a damosell came vnto him, saying,
b.MAT.26.7	There came vnto him a woman, hauing an alabaster boxe of very precious
b.MAT.26.70	But hee denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou saiest.
b.MAT.26.71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another maide saw him, and saide
b.MAT.26.72	And againe hee denied with an oath, I doe not know the man.
b.MAT.26.73	And after a while came vnto him they that stood by, and saide to Peter,
b.MAT.26.74	Then beganne hee to curse and to sweare, saying, I know not the man. And
b.MAT.26.75	And Peter remembred the words of Iesus, which said vnto him, Before the cocke
b.MAT.26.8	But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose
b.MAT.26.9	For this ointment might haue bin sold for much, and giuen to the poore.
b.MAT.2.7	Then Herod, when he had priuily called the Wise men, enquired of them
b.MAT.27.1	When the morning was come, all the chiefe Priests and Elders of the people,
b.MAT.27.10	And gaue them for the potters field, as the Lord appointed me.)
b.MAT.27.11	And Iesus stood before the gouernour, and the gouernour asked him, saying;
b.MAT.27.12	And when hee was accused of the chiefe Priests and Elders, he answered
b.MAT.27.13	Then saith Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witnesse
b.MAT.27.14	And he answered him to neuer a word: insomuch that the Gouernour marueiled
b.MAT.27.15	Now at that feast the Gouernor was woont to release vnto the people a
b.MAT.27.16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
b.MAT.27.17	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said vnto them, Whom will
b.MAT.27.18	For hee knew that for enuie they had deliuered him.
b.MAT.27.19	When he was set downe on the Iudgement seate, his wife sent vnto him, saying,
b.MAT.27.2	And when they had bound him, they led him away, and deliuered him to Pontius
b.MAT.27.20	But the chiefe Priestes and Elders perswaded the multitude that they should
b.MAT.27.21	The Gouernour answered, and said vnto them, Whether of the twaine will ye
b.MAT.27.22	Pilate said vnto them, What shall I doe then with Iesus, which is called
b.MAT.27.23	And the Gouernour said, Why, what euil hath he done? But they cried out ye
b.MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he could preuaile nothing, but that rather a tumult was
b.MAT.27.25	Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on vs, and on our
b.MAT.27.26	Then released hee Barabbas vnto them, and when he had scourged Iesus, he
b.MAT.27.27	Then the souldiers of the Gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and
b.MAT.27.28	And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
b.MAT.27.29	And when they had platted a crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head, and
b.MAT.27.3	Then Iudas, which had betraied him, when he saw that hee was condemned,
b.MAT.27.30	And they spit vpon him, and tooke the reed, and smote him on the head.
b.MAT.27.31	And after that they had mocked him, they tooke the robe off from him, and put
b.MAT.27.32	And as they came out, they found a man of
b.MAT.27.33	And when they were come vnto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place
b.MAT.27.34	They gaue him vineger to drinke, mingled with gall: and when hee had tasted
b.MAT.27.35	And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might
b.MAT.27.36	And sitting downe, they watched him there:
b.MAT.27.37	And set vp ouer his head, his accusation written, THIS IS IESVS THE KING OF
b.MAT.27.38	Then were there two theeues crucified with him: one on the right hand, and
b.MAT.27.39	And they that passed by, reuiled him, wagging their heads,
b.MAT.27.4	Saying, I haue sinned, in that I haue betraied the innocent blood. And they
b.MAT.27.40	And saying, Thou that destroyest the
b.MAT.27.41	Likewise also the chiefe Priests mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders,
b.MAT.27.42	He saued others, himselfe he cannot saue: If he be the King of Israel, let
b.MAT.27.43	He trusted in God, let him deliuer him now if hee will haue him: for he said,
b.MAT.27.44	The thieues also which were crucified with him, cast ye same in his teeth.
b.MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth houre there was darkenesse ouer all the land vnto the
b.MAT.27.46	And about the ninth houre, Iesus cried with a loud voyce, saying, Eli, Eli,
b.MAT.27.47	Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth
b.MAT.27.48	And straightway one of them ran, and tooke a spunge, and filled it with
b.MAT.27.49	The rest said, Let bee, let vs see whether Elias will come to saue him.
b.MAT.27.5	And hee cast downe the pieces of siluer in the
b.MAT.27.50	Iesus, when hee had cried againe with a loud voice, yeelded vp the ghost.
b.MAT.27.51	And behold, the vaile of the
b.MAT.27.52	And the graues were opened, and many bodies of Saints which slept, arose,
b.MAT.27.53	And came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy
b.MAT.27.54	Now when the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Iesus, saw the
b.MAT.27.55	And many women were there (beholding afarre off) which followed Iesus from
b.MAT.27.56	Among which was Mary Magdalene, &amp; Mary the mother of Iames and Ioses, and
b.MAT.27.57	When the Euen was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Ioseph, who
b.MAT.27.58	He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Iesus: then Pilate commanded the
b.MAT.27.59	And when Ioseph had taken the body, hee wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth,
b.MAT.27.6	And the chiefe Priests tooke the siluer pieces, and said, It is not lawfull
b.MAT.27.60	And laide it in his owne newe tombe, which he had hewen out in the rocke: and
b.MAT.27.61	And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting ouer against the
b.MAT.27.62	Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation, the chiefe Priests
b.MAT.27.63	Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiuer said, while he was yet aliue,
b.MAT.27.64	Command therfore that the sepulchre be made sure, vntill the third day, lest
b.MAT.27.65	Pilate said vnto them, Yee haue a watch, goe your way, make it as sure as you
b.MAT.27.66	So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a
b.MAT.27.7	And they tooke counsell, and bought with them the potters field, to burie
b.MAT.27.8	Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood vnto this day.
b.MAT.27.9	(Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremie the Prophet, saying, And
b.MAT.2.8	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Goe, and search diligently for the
b.MAT.28.1	In the ende of the Sabbath, as it began to dawne towards the first day of the
b.MAT.28.10	Then said Iesus vnto them, Be not afraid: Goe tell my brethren that they goe
b.MAT.28.11	Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the citie, and
b.MAT.28.12	And when they were assembled with the Elders, and had taken counsell, they
b.MAT.28.13	Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
b.MAT.28.14	And if this come to the gouernours eares, wee will perswade him, and secure
b.MAT.28.15	So they tooke the money, and did as they were taught. And this saying is
b.MAT.28.16	Then the eleuen disciples went away into
b.MAT.28.17	And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
b.MAT.28.18	And Iesus came, and spake vnto them, saying, All power is giuen vnto me in
b.MAT.28.19	Goe ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the
b.MAT.28.2	And behold, there was a great earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord descended
b.MAT.28.20	Teaching them to obserue all things, whatsoeuer I haue commanded you: and loe,
b.MAT.28.3	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snowe.
b.MAT.28.4	And for feare of him, the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
b.MAT.28.5	And the Angel answered, and said vnto the women, Feare not ye: for I know that
b.MAT.28.6	He is not here: for he is risen, as hee said: Come, see the place where the
b.MAT.28.7	And goe quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And
b.MAT.28.8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with feare and great ioy, and
b.MAT.28.9	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Iesus met them, saying, All
b.MAT.2.9	When they had heard the King, they departed, and loe, the Starre which they
b.MAT.3.1	In those daies came Iohn the Baptist, preaching in the wildernesse of Iudea,
b.MAT.3.10	And now also the axe is layd vnto the root of the trees: Therefore euery tree
b.MAT.3.11	I indeed baptize you with water vnto repentance: but he that commeth after
b.MAT.3.12	Whose fanne is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floore, and
b.MAT.3.13	Then commeth Iesus from
b.MAT.3.14	But Iohn forbade him, saying, I haue need to bee baptized of thee, and
b.MAT.3.15	And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it
b.MAT.3.16	And Iesus, when hee was baptized, went vp straightway out of the water: and
b.MAT.3.17	And loe, a voice from heauen, saying, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am
b.MAT.3.2	And saying, Repent yee: for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.
b.MAT.3.3	For this is he that was spoken of by the Prophet Esaias, saying, The voyce of
b.MAT.3.4	And the same Iohn had his raiment of camels haire, and a leatherne girdle
b.MAT.3.5	Then went out to him Hierusalem, and all Iudea, and all the region round about
b.MAT.3.6	And were baptized of him in Iordane, confessing their sinnes.
b.MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his Baptisme, he
b.MAT.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.
b.MAT.3.9	And thinke not to say within your selues, Wee haue Abraham to our father: For
b.MAT.4.1	Then was Iesus led vp of the Spirit into the wildernesse, to bee tempted of
b.MAT.4.10	Then saith Iesus vnto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou
b.MAT.4.11	Then the deuill leaueth him, and behold, Angels came and ministred vnto him.
b.MAT.4.12	Now when Iesus had heard that Iohn was cast into prison, he departed into
b.MAT.4.13	And leauing Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is vpon the Sea
b.MAT.4.14	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,
b.MAT.4.15	The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthali, by the way of the Sea beyond
b.MAT.4.16	The people which sate in darkenesse, saw great light: and to them which sate
b.MAT.4.17	From that time Iesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdome of
b.MAT.4.18	And Iesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon, called
b.MAT.4.19	And he saith vnto them, Follow mee: and I will make you fishers of men.
b.MAT.4.2	And when hee had fasted forty dayes and forty nights, hee was afterward an
b.MAT.4.20	And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
b.MAT.4.21	And going on from thence, hee sawe other two brethren, Iames the sonne of
b.MAT.4.22	And they immediatly left the shippe and their father, and followed him.
b.MAT.4.23	And Iesus went about all
b.MAT.4.24	And his fame went thorowout all Syria: and they brought vnto him all sicke
b.MAT.4.25	And there followed him great great multitudes of people, from Galilee, and
b.MAT.4.3	And when the tempter came to him, hee said, If thou be the sonne of God,
b.MAT.4.4	But he answered, and said, It is written, Man shall not liue by bread alone,
b.MAT.4.5	Then the deuill taketh him vp into the holy Citie, and setteth him on a
b.MAT.4.6	And saith vnto him, If thou bee the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: For it
b.MAT.4.7	Iesus said vnto him, It is written againe, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
b.MAT.4.8	Againe the Deuill taketh him vp into an exceeding high mountaine, and sheweth
b.MAT.4.9	And saith vnto him, All these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe
b.MAT.5.1	And seeing the multitudes, he went vp into a mountaine: and when he was set,
b.MAT.5.10	Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnesse sake: for theirs is
b.MAT.5.11	Blessed are ye, when men shall reuile you, and persecute you, and shal say
b.MAT.5.12	Reioyce, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heauen: For so
b.MAT.5.13	Yee are the salt of the earth: But if the salt haue lost his sauour,
b.MAT.5.14	Yee are the light of the world. A citie that is set on an hill, cannot be
b.MAT.5.15	Neither doe men light a candle, and put it vnder a bushell: but on a
b.MAT.5.16	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and
b.MAT.5.17	Thinke not that I am come to destroy the lawe or the Prophets. I am not come
b.MAT.5.18	For verily I say vnto you, Till heauen and earth passe, one iote or one
b.MAT.5.19	Whosoeuer therfore shall breake one of these least commaundements, and shall
b.MAT.5.2	And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
b.MAT.5.20	For I say vnto you, That except your righteousnesse shall exceede the
b.MAT.5.21	Yee haue heard, that it was saide by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill:
b.MAT.5.22	But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer is angry with his brother without a cause,
b.MAT.5.23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy
b.MAT.5.24	Leaue there thy gift before the altar, and goe thy way, first be reconciled
b.MAT.5.25	Agree with thine aduersarie quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him:
b.MAT.5.26	Uerily I say vnto thee, thou shalt by no meanes come out thence, till thou
b.MAT.5.27	Yee haue heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit
b.MAT.5.28	But I say vnto you, That whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
b.MAT.5.29	And if thy right eie offend thee, plucke it out, and cast it from thee. For
b.MAT.5.3	Blessed are the poore in spirit: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.
b.MAT.5.30	And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. For it
b.MAT.5.31	It hath beene said, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a
b.MAT.5.32	But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, sauing for the
b.MAT.5.33	Againe, yee haue heard that it hath beene said by them of old time, Thou
b.MAT.5.34	But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is Gods
b.MAT.5.35	Nor by the earth, for it is his footstoole: neither by Hierusalem, for it is
b.MAT.5.36	Neither shalt thou sweare by thy head, because thou canst not make one haire
b.MAT.5.37	But let your communication bee Yea, yea: Nay, nay: For whatsoeuer is more
b.MAT.5.38	Yee haue heard that it hath beene said, An eie for an eie, and a tooth for a
b.MAT.5.39	But I say vnto you, that yee resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee
b.MAT.5.4	Blessed are they that mourne: for they shall be comforted.
b.MAT.5.40	And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him
b.MAT.5.41	And whosoeuer shall compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.
b.MAT.5.42	Giue to him that asketh thee: and from him that would borrow of thee, turne
b.MAT.5.43	Yee haue heard, that it hath beene said, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and
b.MAT.5.44	But I say vnto you, Loue your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good
b.MAT.5.45	That yee may be the children of your father which is in heauen: for he maketh
b.MAT.5.46	For if yee loue them which loue you, what reward haue yee? Doe not euen the
b.MAT.5.47	And if yee salute your brethren only, what do you more then others? Doe not
b.MAT.5.48	Be yee therefore perfect, euen as your father, which is in heauen, is
b.MAT.5.5	Blessed are the meeke: for they shall inherit the earth.
b.MAT.5.6	Blessed are they which doe hunger and thirst after righteousnesse: for they
b.MAT.5.7	Blessed are the mercifull: for they shall obtaine mercie.
b.MAT.5.8	Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
b.MAT.5.9	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall bee called the children of God.
b.MAT.6.1	Take heed that yee doe not your almes before men, to bee seene of them:
b.MAT.6.10	Thy kingdome come. Thy will be done, in earth, as it is in heauen.
b.MAT.6.11	Giue vs this day our daily bread.
b.MAT.6.12	And forgiue vs our debts, as we forgiue our debters.
b.MAT.6.13	And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill: For thine is the
b.MAT.6.14	For, if yee forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenly father will also
b.MAT.6.15	But, if yee forgiue not men their trespasses, neither will your father
b.MAT.6.16	Moreouer, when yee fast, be not as the Hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for
b.MAT.6.17	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face:
b.MAT.6.18	That thou appeare not vnto men to fast, but vnto thy father which is in
b.MAT.6.19	Lay not vp for your selues treasures vpon earth, where moth and rust doth
b.MAT.6.2	Therefore, when thou doest thine almes, doe not sound a trumpet before thee,
b.MAT.6.20	But lay vp for your selues treasures in heauen, where neither moth nor rust
b.MAT.6.21	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
b.MAT.6.22	The light of the body is the eye: If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole
b.MAT.6.23	But if thine eye be euill, thy whole body shall be full of darknesse. If
b.MAT.6.24	No man can serue two masters: for either he will hate the one and loue the
b.MAT.6.25	Therfore I say vnto you, Take no thought for your life, what yee shall eate,
b.MAT.6.26	Behold the foules of the aire: for they sow not, neither do they reape, nor
b.MAT.6.27	Which of you by taking thought, can adde one cubite vnto his stature?
b.MAT.6.28	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lillies of the field, how
b.MAT.6.29	And yet I say vnto you, that euen Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed
b.MAT.6.3	But when thou doest almes, let not thy left hand know, what thy right doeth:
b.MAT.6.30	Wherefore, if God so clothe the
b.MAT.6.31	Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eate? or, what shall we
b.MAT.6.32	(For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke:) for your heauenly father
b.MAT.6.33	But seeke ye first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these
b.MAT.6.34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought
b.MAT.6.4	That thine almes may be in secret: And thy father which seeth in secret,
b.MAT.6.5	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they loue
b.MAT.6.6	But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy
b.MAT.6.7	But when yee pray, vse not vaine repetitions, as the heathen doe. For they
b.MAT.6.8	Be not yee therefore like vnto them: For your father knoweth what things yee
b.MAT.6.9	After this maner therefore pray yee: Our father which art in heauen, hallowed
b.MAT.7.1	Iudge not, that ye be not iudged.
b.MAT.7.10	Or if he aske a fish, will hee giue him a serpent?
b.MAT.7.11	If ye then being euill, know how to giue good giftes vnto your children, how
b.MAT.7.12	Therefore all things whatsoeuer ye would that men should doe to you, doe ye
b.MAT.7.13	Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way
b.MAT.7.14	Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth vnto life,
b.MAT.7.15	Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheepes clothing, but inwardly
b.MAT.7.16	Yee shall knowe them by their fruits: Doe men gather grapes of thornes, or
b.MAT.7.17	Euen so, euery good tree bringeth forth good fruit: but a corrupt tree
b.MAT.7.18	A good tree cannot bring forth euil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring
b.MAT.7.19	Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe, and cast into
b.MAT.7.2	For with what iudgment ye iudge, yee shall be iudged: and with what measure ye
b.MAT.7.20	Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
b.MAT.7.21	Not euery one that saith vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome
b.MAT.7.22	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, haue we not prophecied in thy
b.MAT.7.23	And then wil I professe vnto them, I neuer knew you: Depart from me, ye that
b.MAT.7.24	Therefore, whosoeuer heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I wil
b.MAT.7.25	And the raine descended, and the floods came, and the windes blew, and beat
b.MAT.7.26	And euery one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall
b.MAT.7.27	And the raine descended, and the floods came, and the windes blew, and beat
b.MAT.7.28	And it came to passe, when Iesus had ended these sayings, the people were
b.MAT.7.29	For he taught them as one hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes.
b.MAT.7.3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but considerest
b.MAT.7.4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let mee pull out the mote out of thine
b.MAT.7.5	Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beame out of thine owne eye: and then shalt
b.MAT.7.6	Giue not that which is holy vnto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearles before
b.MAT.7.7	Aske, and it shalbe giuen you: seeke, and ye shall finde: knocke, and it
b.MAT.7.8	For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him
b.MAT.7.9	Or what man is there of you, whom if his sonne aske bread, will hee giue him a
b.MAT.8.1	When he was come downe from the Mountaine, great multitudes folowed him.
b.MAT.8.10	When Iesus heard it, he marueiled, and said to them that followed, Uerely, I
b.MAT.8.11	And I say vnto you, that many shall come from the East and West, and shal sit
b.MAT.8.12	But the children of the kingdome shall be cast out into outer darkenesse:
b.MAT.8.13	And Iesus said vnto the Centurion, Go thy way, and as thou hast beleeued, so
b.MAT.8.14	And when Iesus was come into Peters house, hee saw his wiues mother laid, and
b.MAT.8.15	And he touched her hand, and the feuer left her: and she arose, and ministred
b.MAT.8.16	When the Euen was come, they brought vnto him many that were possessed with
b.MAT.8.17	That it might be fulfilled which which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet,
b.MAT.8.18	Now when Iesus saw great multitudes about him, hee gaue commaundement to
b.MAT.8.19	And a certaine Scribe came, and said vnto him, Master, I will follow thee
b.MAT.8.2	And behold, there came a leper, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, If thou
b.MAT.8.20	And Iesus saith vnto him, The Foxes haue holes, and the birds of the ayre
b.MAT.8.21	And another of his Disciples said vnto him, Lord, suffer me first to goe, and
b.MAT.8.22	But Iesus said vnto him, Follow me, &amp; let the dead, bury their dead.
b.MAT.8.23	And when he was entred into a ship, his Disciples followed him.
b.MAT.8.24	And behold, there arose a great tempest in the Sea, insomuch that the ship
b.MAT.8.25	And his Disciples came to him, and awoke, saying, Lord, saue vs: we perish.
b.MAT.8.26	And he saith vnto them, Why are yee fearefull, O yee of litle faith? Then hee
b.MAT.8.27	But the men marueiled, saying, What maner of man is this, that euen the winds
b.MAT.8.28	And when hee was come to the other side, into the countrey of the Gergesenes,
b.MAT.8.29	And behold, they cryed out, saying, What haue we to doe with thee, Iesus thou
b.MAT.8.3	And Iesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will, bee thou cleane.
b.MAT.8.30	And there was a good way off from them, an heard of many swine, feeding.
b.MAT.8.31	So the deuils besought him, saying, If thou cast vs out, suffer vs to goe
b.MAT.8.32	And he said vnto them, Goe. And when they were come out, they went into the
b.MAT.8.33	And they that kept them, fled, and went their waies into the citie, and told
b.MAT.8.34	And behold, the whole citie came out to meete Iesus: and when they saw him,
b.MAT.8.4	And Iesus saith vnto him, See thou tell no man, but go thy way, shew thy selfe
b.MAT.8.5	And when Iesus was entred into
b.MAT.8.6	And saying, Lord, my seruant lieth at home sicke of the palsie, grieuously
b.MAT.8.7	And Iesus saith vnto him, I will come, and heale him.
b.MAT.8.8	The Centurion answered, and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest
b.MAT.8.9	For I am a man vnder authority, hauing souldiers vnder me: and I say to this
b.MAT.9.1	And hee entred into a ship, and passed ouer, and came into his owne citie.
b.MAT.9.10	And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at meate in the house, behold, many
b.MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said vnto his disciples, Why eateth your
b.MAT.9.12	But when Iesus heard that, hee said vnto them, They that be whole neede not a
b.MAT.9.13	But goe ye and learne what that meaneth, I will haue mercy and not sacrifice:
b.MAT.9.14	Then came to him the disciples of Iohn, saying, Why doe we and the Pharisees
b.MAT.9.15	And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourne, as
b.MAT.9.16	No man putteth a piece of new cloth vnto an olde garment: for that which is
b.MAT.9.17	Neither doe men put new wine into old bottels: else the bottels breake, and
b.MAT.9.18	While hee spake these things vnto them, beholde, there came a certaine ruler
b.MAT.9.19	And Iesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
b.MAT.9.2	And behold, they brought to him a man sicke of the palsie, lying on a bed: and
b.MAT.9.20	(And behold, a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelue yeeres,
b.MAT.9.21	For she said within her selfe, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be
b.MAT.9.22	But Iesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, bee of
b.MAT.9.23	And when Iesus came into the rulers house, and saw the minstrels and the
b.MAT.9.24	He said vnto them, Giue place, for the mayd is not dead, but sleepeth. And
b.MAT.9.25	But when the people were put foorth, he went in, and tooke her by the hand:
b.MAT.9.26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
b.MAT.9.27	And when Iesus departed thence, two blinde men followed him, crying, and
b.MAT.9.28	And when he was come into the house, the blinde men came to him: and Iesus
b.MAT.9.29	Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith, bee it vnto you.
b.MAT.9.3	And behold, certaine of the Scribes said within themselues, This man
b.MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened: and Iesus straitly charged them, saying, See that
b.MAT.9.31	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that
b.MAT.9.32	As they went out, beholde, they brought to him a dumbe man possessed with a
b.MAT.9.33	And when the deuil was cast out, the dumbe spake, and the multitudes
b.MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, He casteth out the deuils through the prince of the
b.MAT.9.35	And Iesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
b.MAT.9.36	But when he saw the multitudes, he was moued with compassion on them, because
b.MAT.9.37	Then saith he vnto his disciples, The haruest truely is plenteous, but the
b.MAT.9.38	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the haruest, that hee will send foorth
b.MAT.9.4	And Iesus knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore thinke yee euill in your
b.MAT.9.5	For whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Arise,
b.MAT.9.6	But that yee may know that the sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue
b.MAT.9.7	And he arose, and departed to his house.
b.MAT.9.8	But when the multitudes saw it, they marueiled, &amp; glorified God, which had
b.MAT.9.9	And as Iesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at
b.MIC.1.1	The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the dayes of Iotham,
b.MIC.1.10	Declare yee it not at Gath, weepe yee not at all: In the house of Aphrah
b.MIC.1.11	Passe yee away thou inhabitant of Saphir, hauing thy shame naked; the
b.MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good, but euill came downe
b.MIC.1.13	O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the charet to the swift beast: she is the
b.MIC.1.14	Therfore shalt thou giue presents to Moresheth-Gath: the houses of Achzib
b.MIC.1.15	Yet wil I bring an heire vnto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come
b.MIC.1.16	Make thee bald, and polle thee for thy delicate children, enlarge thy
b.MIC.1.2	Heare all ye people, hearken O earth, and all that therein is, and let the
b.MIC.1.3	For behold, the Lord commeth forth out of his place, and will come downe and
b.MIC.1.4	And the mountaines shall be molten vnder him, and the valleis shall be cleft:
b.MIC.1.5	For the transgression of Iacob is all this, and for the sinnes of the house of
b.MIC.1.6	Therfore I will make Samaria as an heape of the field, and as plantings of a
b.MIC.1.7	And all the grauen images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires
b.MIC.1.8	Therfore I wil waile and houle, I will goe stript and naked: I will make a
b.MIC.1.9	For her wound is incurable, for it is come vnto Iudah: he is come vnto the
b.MIC.2.1	Woe to them that deuise iniquitie, and worke euill vpon their beds: when the
b.MIC.2.10	Arise ye and depart, for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it
b.MIC.2.11	If a man walking in the spirit and falshood, doe lie, saying, I will
b.MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, O Iacob, all of thee: I will surely gather the
b.MIC.2.13	The breaker is come vp before them: they haue broken vp and haue passed
b.MIC.2.2	And they couet fields and take them by violence: and houses, and take them
b.MIC.2.3	Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, against this familie doe I deuise an
b.MIC.2.4	In that day shall one take vp a parable against you, and lament with a
b.MIC.2.5	Therefore thou shalt haue none that shall cast a cord by lot in the
b.MIC.2.6	Prophecie ye not, say they, to them that prophecie: they shall not prophecie
b.MIC.2.7	O thou that art named the house of Iacob, is the Spirit of the Lord straitned?
b.MIC.2.8	Euen of late, my people is risen vp as an enemie: ye pull off the robe with
b.MIC.2.9	The women of my people haue ye cast out from their pleasant houses, from their
b.MIC.3.1	And I said, Heare, I pray you, O heads of Iacob, and ye princes of the house
b.MIC.3.10	They build vp Zion with blood, and Ierusalem with iniquitie.
b.MIC.3.11	The heads thereof iudge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hyre,
b.MIC.3.12	Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Ierusalem shal
b.MIC.3.2	Who hate the good and loue the euill, who plucke off their skinne from off
b.MIC.3.3	Who also eate the flesh of my people, and flay their skinne from off them, and
b.MIC.3.4	Then shall they cry vnto the Lord, but he will not heare them: he will euen
b.MIC.3.5	Thus saith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my people erre, that
b.MIC.3.6	Therefore night shall be vnto you, that yee shall not haue a vision, and it
b.MIC.3.7	Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diuiners confounded: yea, they shall
b.MIC.3.8	But truely I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of iudgment and
b.MIC.3.9	Heare this, I pray you, yee heads of the house of Iacob, and princes of the
b.MIC.4.1	But in the last dayes it shal come to passe, that the mountaine of the house
b.MIC.4.10	Bee in paine and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in
b.MIC.4.11	Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be
b.MIC.4.12	But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither vnderstand they his
b.MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horne yron, &amp;
b.MIC.4.2	And many nations shall come, and say; Come, and let vs goe vp to the mountaine
b.MIC.4.3	And he shall iudge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afarre off,
b.MIC.4.4	But they shall sit euery man vnder his Uine, and vnder his figgetree, and none
b.MIC.4.5	For all people will walke euery one in the name of his god, and we will walke
b.MIC.4.6	In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will
b.MIC.4.7	And I will make her that halted, a remnant; and her that was cast farre off, a
b.MIC.4.8	And thou, O towre of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, vnto
b.MIC.4.9	Now why doest thou cry out alowd? is there no king in thee? is thy counseller
b.MIC.5.1	Now gather thy selfe in troupes, O daughter of troupes: he hath laid siege
b.MIC.5.10	And it shall come to passe in that day, sayth the Lord, that I will cut off
b.MIC.5.11	And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw downe all thy strong
b.MIC.5.12	And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand, and thou shalt haue no more
b.MIC.5.13	Thy grauen images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the
b.MIC.5.14	And I will plucke vp thy groues out of the middest of thee: so will I destroy
b.MIC.5.15	And I will execute vengeance in anger, and furie vpon the heathen, such as
b.MIC.5.2	But thou Beth-leem Ephratah, though thou bee little among the thousands of
b.MIC.5.3	Therefore will hee giue them vp, vntill the time that shee which trauaileth,
b.MIC.5.4	And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the Maiestie of
b.MIC.5.5	And this man shall bee the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land:
b.MIC.5.6	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of
b.MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Iacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a dew from
b.MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Iacob shal be among the Gentiles in the middest of many
b.MIC.5.9	Thine hand shall be lift vp vpon thine aduersaries, and all thine enemies
b.MIC.6.1	Heare yee now what the Lord saith, Arise, contend thou before the mountaines,
b.MIC.6.10	Are there yet the treasures of wickednesse in the house of the wicked, and
b.MIC.6.11	Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of
b.MIC.6.12	For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof
b.MIC.6.13	Therefore also will I make thee sicke in smiting thee, in making thee
b.MIC.6.14	Thou shalt eate, but not be satisfied, and thy casting downe shall be in the
b.MIC.6.15	Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reape: thou shalt tread the oliues, but
b.MIC.6.16	For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the workes of the house of Ahab,
b.MIC.6.2	Heare yee, O mountaines, the Lords controuersie, and ye strong foundations of
b.MIC.6.3	O my people, what haue I done vnto thee, and wherein haue I wearied thee?
b.MIC.6.4	For I brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the
b.MIC.6.5	O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam
b.MIC.6.6	Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my selfe before the high God?
b.MIC.6.7	Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rammes, or with tenne thousands of
b.MIC.6.8	Hee hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doeth the Lord require of
b.MIC.6.9	The Lords voice cryeth vnto the citie, and the man of wisedome shall see thy
b.MIC.7.1	Woe is mee, for I am as when they haue gathered the summer fruits, as the
b.MIC.7.10	Then she that is mine enemie shall see it, and shame shall couer her which

b.NEH.4.1	But it came to passe, that when Sanballat heard, that we builded the wall, he
b.NEH.4.10	And Iudah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there
b.NEH.4.11	And our aduersaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till wee come in
b.NEH.4.12	And it came to passe that when the Iewes which dwelt by them, came, they said
b.NEH.4.13	Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher
b.NEH.4.14	And I looked, and rose vp, and said vnto the Nobles, and to the rulers, and
b.NEH.4.15	And it came to passe when our enemies heard that it was knowen vnto vs, and
b.NEH.4.16	And it came to passe from that time forth, that the halfe of my seruants
b.NEH.4.17	They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that
b.NEH.4.18	For the builders, euery one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded:
b.NEH.4.19	And I said vnto the Nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people,
b.NEH.4.2	And he spake before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What doe
b.NEH.4.20	In what place therefore ye heare the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither
b.NEH.4.21	So wee laboured in the worke: and halfe of them held the speares, from the

b.NEH.4.4	Heare, O our God, for we are despised: and turne their reproch vpon their owne
b.NEH.4.5	And couer not their iniquitie, and let not their sinne bee blotted out from
b.NEH.4.6	So built we the wall, and all the wall was ioyned together vnto the halfe
b.NEH.4.7	But it came to passe that when Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the
b.NEH.4.8	And conspired all of them together, to come and to fight against Ierusalem,
b.NEH.4.9	Neuertheles, we made our prayer vnto our God, and set a watch against them,
b.NEH.5.1	And there was a great crie of the people, and of their wiues, against their
b.NEH.5.10	I likewise, and my brethren, and my seruants, might exact of them money and
b.NEH.5.11	Restore, I pray you, to them, euen this day, their lands, their vineyards,
b.NEH.5.12	Then said they, Wee will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so
b.NEH.5.13	Also I shooke my lap, and said, So God shake out euery man from his house,
b.NEH.5.14	Moreouer, from the time that I was appointed to be their gouernor in the land
b.NEH.5.15	But the former gouernours that had bene before me, were chargeable vnto the
b.NEH.5.16	Yea also I continued in the worke of this wall, neither bought wee any land:
b.NEH.5.17	Moreouer, there were at my table, an hundred and fiftie of the Iewes and
b.NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for me daily, was one oxe, and sixe choice sheepe;
b.NEH.5.19	Thinke vpon mee, my God, for good, according to all that I haue done for this
b.NEH.5.2	For there were that said, We, our sonnes, and our daughters are many:
b.NEH.5.3	Some also there were that saide, We haue morgaged our landes, vineyards and
b.NEH.5.4	There were also that said, Wee haue borrowed money for the kings tribute, and
b.NEH.5.5	Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their
b.NEH.5.6	And I was very angry, when I heard their crie, and these words.
b.NEH.5.7	Then I consulted with my selfe, and I rebuked the Nobles, and the rulers, and
b.NEH.5.8	And I said vnto them, We, after our abilitie, haue redeemed our brethren the
b.NEH.5.9	Also I said, It is not good that yee doe: ought yee not to walke in the feare
b.NEH.6.1	Now it came to passe when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and
b.NEH.6.10	Afterward I came vnto the house of Shemaiah the sonne of Delaiah, the sonne
b.NEH.6.11	And I said, Should such a man as I, flee? and who is there, that being as I
b.NEH.6.12	And loe, I perceiued that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this
b.NEH.6.13	Therefore was hee hired, that I should be afraid, and doe so, and sinne, and
b.NEH.6.14	My God, thinke thou vpon Tobiah, and Sanballat, according to these their
b.NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished, in the twentie and fifth day of the moneth Elul, in
b.NEH.6.16	And it came to passe that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the
b.NEH.6.17	Moreouer, in those dayes the nobles of Iudah sent many letters vnto Tobiah,
b.NEH.6.18	For there were many in Iudah sworne vnto him: because hee was the sonne in
b.NEH.6.19	Also they reported his good deeds before me, and vttered my wordes to him:
b.NEH.6.2	That Sanballat, and Geshem sent vnto me, saying, Come, let vs meet together in
b.NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers vnto them, saying, I am doing a great worke, so that I
b.NEH.6.4	Yet they sent vnto me foure times, after this sort; and I answered them after
b.NEH.6.5	Then sent Sanballat his seruant vnto me, in like manner, the fifth time, with
b.NEH.6.6	Wherein was written; It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu sayth it,
b.NEH.6.7	And thou hast also appointed Prophets to preach of thee at Ierusalem, saying,
b.NEH.6.8	Then I sent vnto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest,

b.NUM.1.17	And Moses and Aaron tooke these men, which are expressed by their names.
b.NUM.11.7	And the Manna was as Coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of
b.NUM.1.18	And they assembled all the Congregation together on the first day of the
b.NUM.11.8	And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in milles, or beat
b.NUM.1.19	As the Lord commaunded Moses, so he numbred them in the wildernesse of Sinai.
b.NUM.11.9	And when the dew fell vpon the campe in the night, the Manna fell vpon it.

b.NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spie out the land: and
b.NUM.13.17	And Moses sent them to spie out the land of Canaan, and said vnto them, Get
b.NUM.13.18	And see the lande what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether

b.NUM.13.21	So they went vp, and searched the land, from the wildernesse of Zin, vnto
b.NUM.13.22	And they ascended by the South, and came vnto Hebron: where Ahiman, Sheshai,

b.NUM.13.24	The place was called the brooke Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes
b.NUM.13.25	And they returned from searching of the land after fourty dayes.
b.NUM.13.26	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the Congregation of

b.NUM.13.33	And there we saw the giants, the sonnes of Anak, which come of the giants:
b.NUM.1.34	Of the children of Manasseh by their generations, after their families, by

b.NUM.14.20	And the Lord said, I haue pardoned, according to thy word.
b.NUM.14.21	But as truly as I liue, all the earth shalbe filled with the glory of the
b.NUM.14.22	Because all those men which haue seene my glory, and my miracles which I did
b.NUM.14.23	Surely they shall not see the land which I sware vnto their fathers, neither

b.NUM.1.43	Those that were numbred of them, euen of the tribe of Naphtali, were fiftie
b.NUM.14.3	And wherefore hath the Lord brought vs vnto this land, to fall by the sword,
b.NUM.14.30	Doubtlesse ye shall not come into the land concerning which I sware to make
b.NUM.14.31	But your little ones, which yee said should be a pray, them will I bring in,

b.NUM.14.8	If the Lord delight in vs, then he will bring vs into this land, and giue it
b.NUM.1.49	Onely thou shalt not number the tribe of Leui, neither take the summe of them
b.NUM.14.9	Onely rebell not yee against the Lord, neither feare yee the people of the

b.NUM.1.51	And when the Tabernacle setteth forward, the Leuites shall take it downe: and
b.NUM.15.1	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.15.10	And thou shalt bring for a drinke offering halfe an Hyn of wine, for an
b.NUM.15.11	Thus shall it be done for one bullocke, or for one ramme, or for a lambe, or
b.NUM.15.12	According to the number that yee shall prepare, so shall yee doe to euery
b.NUM.15.13	All that are borne of the countrey shall doe these things after this maner,
b.NUM.15.14	And if a stranger soiourne with you, or whosoeuer bee among you in your
b.NUM.15.15	One ordinance shall be both for you of the Congregation, and also for the
b.NUM.15.16	One law, and one maner shall be for you, and for the stranger that soiourneth
b.NUM.15.17	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.15.18	Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye come into the
b.NUM.15.19	Then it shall be that when ye eate of the bread of the land, yee shall offer

b.NUM.15.20	Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dough, for an heaue offring: as
b.NUM.15.21	Of the first of your dough ye shal giue vnto the Lord, an heaue offering in

b.NUM.16.14	Moreouer, thou hast not brought vs into a land that floweth with milke and
b.NUM.16.15	And Moses was very wroth, and said vnto the Lord, Respect not thou their
b.NUM.16.16	And Moses said vnto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the Lord, thou,
b.NUM.16.17	And take euery man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring yee before
b.NUM.16.18	And they tooke euery man his censer, and put fire in them, and laide incense
b.NUM.16.19	And Korah gathered all the Congregation against them, vnto the doore of the
b.NUM.16.2	And they rose vp before Moses, with certaine of the children of Israel, two
b.NUM.16.20	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying,
b.NUM.16.21	Separate your selues from among this Congregation, that I may consume them in
b.NUM.16.22	And they fell vpon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of
b.NUM.16.23	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.16.24	Speake vnto the Congregation, saying, Get you vp from about the tabernacle of
b.NUM.16.25	And Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram: and the Elders of Israel
b.NUM.16.26	And hee spake vnto the Congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the
b.NUM.16.27	So they gate vp from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on euery
b.NUM.16.28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to doe all
b.NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the
b.NUM.16.3	And they gathered themselues together against Moses, and against Aaron, and
b.NUM.16.30	But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow
b.NUM.16.31	And it came to passe as he had made an ende of speaking all these words, that
b.NUM.16.32	And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them vp, and their houses, and
b.NUM.16.33	They, and all that appertained to them, went downe aliue into the pit, and
b.NUM.16.34	And all Israel that were round about them, fled at the crie of them: for they
b.NUM.16.35	And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and
b.NUM.16.36	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.16.37	Speake vnto Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest, that he take vp the
b.NUM.16.38	The censers of these sinners against their owne soules, let them make them
b.NUM.16.39	And Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers, wherewith they that were
b.NUM.16.4	And when Moses heard it, he fell vpon his face.
b.NUM.16.40	To bee a memoriall vnto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is
b.NUM.16.41	But on the morrow, all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured
b.NUM.16.42	And it came to passe when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and
b.NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came before the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
b.NUM.16.44	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.16.45	Get you vp from among this Congregation, that I may consume them, as in a

b.NUM.16.48	And he stood betweene the dead and the liuing, and the plague was stayed.
b.NUM.16.49	Now they that died in the plague, were foureteene thousand and seuen hundred,
b.NUM.16.5	And hee spake vnto Korah, and vnto all his company, saying, Euen to morrow the

b.NUM.16.7	And put fire therein, and put incense in them, before the Lord to morrow; And
b.NUM.16.8	And Moses saide vnto Korah, Heare, I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui.
b.NUM.16.9	Seemeth it but a small thing vnto you, that the God of Israel hath separated
b.NUM.1.7	Of Iudah: Nahshon, the sonne of Amminadab.
b.NUM.17.1	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.17.10	And the Lord said vnto Moses, Bring Aarons rod againe before the Testimony,
b.NUM.17.11	And Moses did so: as the Lord commanded him, so did he.
b.NUM.17.12	And the children of Israel spake vnto Moses, saying, Behold, wee die, we
b.NUM.17.13	Whosoeuer commeth any thing neere vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord, shall die:
b.NUM.17.2	Speake vnto the children of Israel, and take of euery one of them a rod,
b.NUM.17.3	And thou shalt write Aarons name vpon the rod of Leui: for one rod shall be
b.NUM.17.4	And thou shalt lay them vp in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before the

b.NUM.17.8	And it came to passe that on the morrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of
b.NUM.17.9	And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord, vnto all the children
b.NUM.1.8	Of Issachar: Nethaneel, the sonne of Zuar.

b.NUM.18.12	All the best of the oyle, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the
b.NUM.18.13	And whatsoeuer is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring vnto the
b.NUM.18.14	Euery thing deuoted in Israel, shall be thine.
b.NUM.18.15	Euery thing that openeth the matrice in all flesh, which they bring vnto the

b.NUM.18.17	But the firstling of a cowe, or the firstling of a sheepe, or the firstling
b.NUM.18.18	And the flesh of them shall bee thine: as the waue breast, and as the right

b.NUM.18.2	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Leui, the tribe of thy father, bring

b.NUM.18.21	And behold, I haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel, for an
b.NUM.18.22	Neither must the children of Israel hencefoorth come nigh the Tabernacle of
b.NUM.18.23	But the Leuites shall doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,
b.NUM.18.24	But the tithes of the children of Israel which they offer as an heaue
b.NUM.18.25	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
b.NUM.18.26	Thus speake vnto the Leuites, and say vnto them, When ye take of the children
b.NUM.18.27	And this your heaue offering shall be reckoned vnto you, as though it were
b.NUM.18.28	Thus you also shal offer an heaue offering vnto the Lord of all your tithes
b.NUM.18.29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer euery heaue offering of the Lord, of all

b.NUM.18.6	And I, beholde, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children
b.NUM.18.7	Therefore thou and thy sonnes with thee, shall keepe your Priests office for

b.NUM.9.13	But the man that is cleane, and is not in a iourney, and forbeareth to keep

b.OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah: Thus saith the Lord God, concerning Edom; Wee haue heard
b.OBA.1.10	For thy violence against thy brother Iacob shame shall couer thee, and thou
b.OBA.1.11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the
b.OBA.1.12	But thou shouldest not haue looked on the day of thy brother in the day that
b.OBA.1.13	Thou shouldest not haue entred into the gate of my people in the day of their
b.OBA.1.14	Neither shouldest thou haue stood in the crosse way to cut off those of his
b.OBA.1.15	For the day of the Lord is neere vpon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it
b.OBA.1.16	For as ye haue drunke vpon my holy mountaine, so shall all the heathen drinke
b.OBA.1.17	But vpon mount Zion shall be deliuerance, and there shall be holinesse, and
b.OBA.1.18	And the house of Iacob shall bee a fire, and the house of Ioseph a flame, and
b.OBA.1.19	And they of the South shall possesse the mount of Esau, and they of the
b.OBA.1.2	Behold, I haue made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.
b.OBA.1.20	And the captiuitie of this hoste of the children of Israel shall possesse
b.OBA.1.21	And Sauiours shall come vp on mount Zion to iudge the mount of Esau, and the
b.OBA.1.3	The pride of thine heart hath deceiued thee: thou that dwellest in the clefts
b.OBA.1.4	Though thou exalt thy selfe as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among
b.OBA.1.5	If theeues came to thee, if robbers by night (how art thou cut off?) would
b.OBA.1.6	How are the things of Esau searched out? how are his hid things sought vp?
b.OBA.1.7	All the men of thy confederacie haue brought thee euen to the border: the men
b.OBA.1.8	Shal I not in that day, saith the Lord, euen destroy the wise men out of Edom,
b.OBA.1.9	And thy mightie men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that euery one of
b.PHI.1.1	Paul and Timotheus the seruants of Iesus Christ, to all the Saints in Christ
b.PHI.1.10	That ye may approue things that are excellent, that ye may be sincere, and
b.PHI.1.11	Being filled with the fruites of righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ
b.PHI.1.12	But I would yee should vnderstand brethren, that the things which happened
b.PHI.1.13	So that my bonds in Christ, are manifest in all the palace, and in all other
b.PHI.1.14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident, by my bonds, are much
b.PHI.1.15	Some in deed preach Christ, euen of enuie and strife, and some also of good
b.PHI.1.16	The one preach Christ of contention, not syncerely, supposing to adde
b.PHI.1.17	But the other of loue, knowing that I am set for the defence of the Gospel.
b.PHI.1.18	What then? Notwithstanding euery way, whether in pretence, or in trueth:
b.PHI.1.19	For I know that this shall turne to my saluation through your prayer, and the
b.PHI.1.2	Grace be vnto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus
b.PHI.1.20	According to my earnest expectation, and my hope, that in nothing I shalbe
b.PHI.1.21	For to me to liue is Christ, and to die is gaine.
b.PHI.1.22	But if I liue in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shal
b.PHI.1.23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, hauing a desire to depart, &amp; to bee
b.PHI.1.24	Neuertheles, to abide in the flesh, is more needfull for you.
b.PHI.1.25	And hauing this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you
b.PHI.1.26	That your reioycing may bee more abundant in Iesus Christ for me, by my
b.PHI.1.27	Onely let your conuersation bee as it becommeth the Gospel of Christ, that
b.PHI.1.28	And in nothing terrified by your aduersaries, which is to them an euident
b.PHI.1.29	For vnto you it is giuen in the behalfe of Christ, not onely to beleeue on
b.PHI.1.3	I thanke my God vpon euery remembrance of you,
b.PHI.1.30	Hauing the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now heare to be in me.
b.PHI.1.4	Alwayes in euery prayer of mine for you all making request, with ioy
b.PHI.1.5	For your felowship in the Gospel from the first day vntill now;
b.PHI.1.6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in
b.PHI.1.7	Euen as it is meete for mee to thinke this of you all, because I haue you in
b.PHI.1.8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all, in the bowels of Iesus
b.PHI.1.9	And this I pray, that your loue may abound yet more &amp; more in knowledge,
b.PHI.2.1	If there bee therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of loue, if
b.PHI.2.10	That at the Name of Iesus euery knee should bow, of things in heauen, and
b.PHI.2.11	And that euery tongue should confesse, that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the
b.PHI.2.12	Wherefore, my beloued, as yee haue alwayes obeyed, not as in my presence
b.PHI.2.13	For it is God which worketh in you, both to will, and to doe, of his good
b.PHI.2.14	Doe all things without murmurings, and disputings:
b.PHI.2.15	That yee may bee blamelesse and harmelesse, the sonnes of God, without
b.PHI.2.16	Holding foorth the word of life, that I may reioyce in the day of Christ,
b.PHI.2.17	Yea, and if I bee offered vpon the sacrifice and seruice of your faith, I ioy,
b.PHI.2.18	For the same cause also doe ye ioy, and reioyce with me.
b.PHI.2.19	But I trust in the Lord Iesus, to send Timotheus shortly vnto you, that I
b.PHI.2.2	Fulfill ye my ioy, that yee be like minded, hauing the same loue, being of one
b.PHI.2.20	For I haue no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.
b.PHI.2.21	For all seeke their owne, not the things which are Iesus Christs.
b.PHI.2.22	But ye know the proofe of him, That as a sonne with the father, hee hath
b.PHI.2.23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soone as I shall see how it wil
b.PHI.2.24	But I trust in the Lord, that I also my selfe shall come shortly.
b.PHI.2.25	Yet I supposed it necessary, to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and
b.PHI.2.26	For hee longed after you all, and was full of heauinesse, because that yee
b.PHI.2.27	For indeed he was sicke nigh vnto death, but God had mercy on him: and not on
b.PHI.2.28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that when ye see him againe, ye may
b.PHI.2.29	Receiue him therfore in the Lord with all gladnesse, and hold such in
b.PHI.2.3	Let nothing bee done through strife, or vaine glory, but in lowlinesse of
b.PHI.2.30	Because for the worke of Christ he was nigh vnto death, not regarding his
b.PHI.2.4	Looke not euery man on his owne things, but euery man also on the things of
b.PHI.2.5	Let this minde bee in you, which was also in Christ Iesus:
b.PHI.2.6	Who being in the forme of God, thought it not robbery to bee equall with God:
b.PHI.2.7	But made himselfe of no reputation, and tooke vpon him the forme of a seruant,
b.PHI.2.8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himselfe, and became obedient
b.PHI.2.9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and giuen him a Name which is
b.PHI.3.1	Finally, my brethren, reioyce in the Lorde. To write the same things to you,
b.PHI.3.10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of
b.PHI.3.11	If by any meanes I might attaine vnto the resurrection of the dead.
b.PHI.3.12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I
b.PHI.3.13	Brethren, I count not my selfe to haue apprehended: but this one thing I doe,
b.PHI.3.14	I presse toward the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Christ
b.PHI.3.15	Let vs therefore, as many as bee perfect, bee thus minded: and if in any
b.PHI.3.16	Neuerthelesse, whereto wee haue alreadie attained, let vs walke by the same
b.PHI.3.17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and marke them which walke so, as ye
b.PHI.3.18	(For many walke, of whome I haue told you often, and now tell you euen
b.PHI.3.19	Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glorie is in
b.PHI.3.2	Beware of dogs, beware of euill workers: beware of the concision.
b.PHI.3.20	For our conuersation is in heauen, from whence also we looke for the Sauiour,
b.PHI.3.21	Who shall change our vile bodie, that it may bee fashioned like vnto his
b.PHI.3.3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and reioyce in

b.PHI.3.8	Yea doubtlesse, and I count all things but losse, for the excellencie of the
b.PHI.3.9	And be found in him, not hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is of the Law,
b.PHI.4.1	Therefore, my brethren, dearely beloued and longed for, my ioy and crowne, so
b.PHI.4.10	But I reioyced in the Lorde greatly, that now at the last your care of me
b.PHI.4.11	Not that I speake in respect of want: for I haue learned in whatsoeuer state
b.PHI.4.12	I know both how to bee abased, and I knowe how to abound: euerie where, and
b.PHI.4.13	I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
b.PHI.4.14	Notwithstanding, yee haue well done, that ye did communicate with my
b.PHI.4.15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I
b.PHI.4.16	For euen in Thessalonica, ye sent once, and againe vnto my necessitie.
b.PHI.4.17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your
b.PHI.4.18	But I haue all, and abound. I am full, hauing receiued of Epaphroditus the
b.PHI.4.19	But my God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory, by

b.PHI.4.21	Salute euery Saint in Christ Iesus: the brethren which are with me, greet
b.PHI.4.22	All the Saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Cesars houshold.
b.PHI.4.23	The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
b.PHI.4.3	And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, helpe those women which laboured
b.PHI.4.4	Reioyce in the Lord alway: and againe I say, Reioyce.
b.PHI.4.5	Let your moderation be knowen vnto all men. The Lord is at hand.
b.PHI.4.6	Bee carefull for nothing: but in euery thing by prayer and supplication with
b.PHI.4.7	And the peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding, shall keepe your hearts
b.PHI.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatsoeuer things are true, whatsoeuer things are honest,
b.PHI.4.9	Those things which ye haue both learned and receiued, and heard, and seene in
b.PHM.1.1	Paul a prisoner of Iesus Christ, &amp; Timothie our brother vnto Philemon our
b.PHM.1.10	I beseech thee for my sonne Onesimus, whome I haue begotten in my bonds,
b.PHM.1.11	Which in time past was to thee vnprofitable: but now profitable to thee and
b.PHM.1.12	Whom I haue sent againe: thou therfore receiue him, that is mine owne bowels.
b.PHM.1.13	Whome I would haue reteined with mee, that in thy stead hee might haue
b.PHM.1.14	But without thy minde would I doe nothing, that thy benefite should not bee
b.PHM.1.15	For perhaps hee therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receiue
b.PHM.1.16	Not now as a seruant, but aboue a seruant, a brother beloued, specially to
b.PHM.1.17	If thou count mee therefore a partner, receiue him as my selfe.
b.PHM.1.18	If hee hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account.
b.PHM.1.19	I Paul haue written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I doe not
b.PHM.1.2	And to our beloued Apphia, and Archippus our fellow Souldier, and to the
b.PHM.1.20	Yea, brother, let mee haue ioy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowles in the
b.PHM.1.21	Hauing confidence in thy obedience, I wrote vnto thee, knowing that thou wilt
b.PHM.1.22	But withall prepare mee also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers
b.PHM.1.23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Iesus:
b.PHM.1.24	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow labourers.
b.PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
b.PHM.1.3	Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Iesus Christ.
b.PHM.1.4	I thanke my God, making mention of thee alwayes in my prayers,
b.PHM.1.5	Hearing of thy loue, and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Iesus, and
b.PHM.1.6	That the communication of thy faith may become effectuall by the acknowledging

b.PSA.78.11	And forgat his workes: and his wonders that he had shewed them.
b.PSA.78.12	Marueilous things did he in the sight of their fathers: in the
b.PSA.78.13	Hee diuided the Sea, and caused them to passe through: and he made the waters
b.PSA.78.14	In the day time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night with a light
b.PSA.78.15	Hee claue the rockes in the wildernes: and gaue them drinke as out of the
b.PSA.78.16	Hee brought streames also out of the rocke, and caused waters to runne downe
b.PSA.78.17	And they sinned yet more against him: by prouoking the most High in the
b.PSA.78.18	And they tempted God in their heart: by asking meat for their lust.
b.PSA.78.19	Yea, they spake against God: they said, Can God furnish a table in the
b.PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I wil vtter darke sayings of old:
b.PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rocke, that the waters gushed out, &amp; the streames
b.PSA.78.21	Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth, so a fire was kindled against
b.PSA.78.22	Because they beleeued not in God: and trusted not in his saluation:
b.PSA.78.23	Though he had commanded the cloudes from aboue: and opened the doores of

b.PSA.78.25	Man did eate Angels food: hee sent them meat to the full.
b.PSA.78.26	He caused an East wind to blow in the heauen: and by his power hee brought in
b.PSA.78.27	He rained flesh also vpon them as dust: and feathered soules like as the sand
b.PSA.78.28	And hee let it fall in the midst of their campe, round about their
b.PSA.78.29	So they did eate, &amp; were well filled: for he gaue them their owne desire.
b.PSA.78.3	Which we haue heard, &amp; knowen: and our fathers haue told vs.
b.PSA.78.30	They were not estranged from their lust: but while their meate was yet in
b.PSA.78.31	The wrath of God came vpon them, and slew the fattest of them: and smote
b.PSA.78.32	For all this they sinned still: and beleeued not for his wondrous works.
b.PSA.78.33	Therefore their dayes did he consume in vanitie, and their yeeres in trouble.
b.PSA.78.34	When hee slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and inquired
b.PSA.78.35	And they remembred that God was their rocke: and the high God, their

b.PSA.78.37	For their heart was not right with him: neither were they stedfast in his

b.PSA.78.39	For he remembred that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and
b.PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come,
b.PSA.78.40	How oft did they prouoke him in the wildernesse: and grieue him in the
b.PSA.78.41	Yea they turned backe and tempted God: and limited the holy one of

b.REV.4.3	And he that sate was to looke vpon like a Iasper, and a Sardine stone: and
b.REV.4.4	And round about the Throne were foure and twentie seates, and vpon the seates
b.REV.4.5	And out of the Throne proceeded lightnings, and thundrings, and voyces: and
b.REV.4.6	And before the Throne there was a sea of glasse like vnto Chrystall: and in
b.REV.4.7	And the first beast was like a Lion, and the second beast like a Calfe, and
b.REV.4.8	And the foure beasts had each of them sixe wings about him, and they were full
b.REV.4.9	And when those beasts giue glory, and honour, and thankes to him that sate on

b.REV.5.10	And hast made vs vnto our God Kings and Priests, and we shall reigne on the
b.REV.5.11	And I beheld, and I heard the voyce of many Angels, round about the Throne,
b.REV.5.12	Saying with a lowd voice, Worthy is the Lambe that was slaine, to receiue
b.REV.5.13	And euery creature which is in heauen, and on the earth, and vnder the earth,
b.REV.5.14	And the foure beasts said, Amen. And the foure and twenty Elders fell downe
b.REV.5.2	And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loude voice; Who is worthy to open
b.REV.5.3	And no man in heauen, nor in earth, neither vnder the earth, was able to open
b.REV.5.4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open, and to reade the

b.REV.5.6	And I beheld, and loe, in the middest of the Throne, and of the foure beastes,
b.REV.5.7	And he came, and tooke the booke out of the right hand of him that sate vpon
b.REV.5.8	And when he had taken the booke, the foure Beasts, and foure and twenty Elders
b.REV.5.9	And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the Booke, and to

b.REV.6.11	And white robes were giuen vnto euery one of them, and it was sayd vnto them,
b.REV.6.12	And I beheld when he had opened the sixt seale, and loe, there was a great
b.REV.6.13	And the starres of heauen fell vnto the earth, euen as a figge tree casteth
b.REV.6.14	And the heauen departed as a scrowle when it is rolled together, and euery
b.REV.6.15	And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the
b.REV.6.16	And said to the mountaines and rockes, Fall on vs, and hide vs from the face
b.REV.6.17	For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?
b.REV.6.2	And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and hee that sate on him had a bowe, and
b.REV.6.3	And when hee had opened the second seale, I heard the second beast say, Come
b.REV.6.4	And there went out another horse that was red: and power was giuen to him that
b.REV.6.5	And when hee had opened the third seale, I heard the third beast say, Come and
b.REV.6.6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the foure beastes say, A measure of wheate
b.REV.6.7	And when hee had opened the fourth seale, I heard the voice of the fourth
b.REV.6.8	And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, &amp; his name that sate on him was
b.REV.6.9	And when hee had opened the fift seale, I saw vnder the altar, the soules of
b.REV.7.1	And after these things, I saw foure Angels standing on the foure corners of
b.REV.7.10	And cryed with a loude voice, saying, Saluation to our God, which sitteth
b.REV.7.11	And all the Angels stood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and
b.REV.7.12	Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glorie, and wisedome, and thankesgiuing, and
b.REV.7.13	And one of the Elders answered, saying vnto mee, What are these which are
b.REV.7.14	And I said vnto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they
b.REV.7.15	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serue him day and night in
b.REV.7.16	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sunne
b.REV.7.17	For the Lambe, which is in the middest of the throne, shall feede them, and
b.REV.7.2	And I saw another Angel ascending from the East, hauing the seale of the
b.REV.7.3	Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till wee haue
b.REV.7.4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an

b.REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelue thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthali
b.REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelue thousand. Of the tribe of Leui were
b.REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelue thousand. Of the tribe of Ioseph
b.REV.7.9	After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could nuber, of
b.REV.8.1	And when hee had opened the seuenth seale, there was silence in heauen about
b.REV.8.10	And the third Angel sounded, and there fell a great starre from heauen,
b.REV.8.11	And the name of the starre is called Wormewood, and the third part of the
b.REV.8.12	And the fourth Angel sounded, and the thirde part of the Sunne was smitten,
b.REV.8.13	And I beheld, and heard an Angel flying through the midst of heauen, saying
b.REV.8.2	And I sawe the seuen Angels which stood before God, and to them were giuen
b.REV.8.3	And another Angel came &amp; stood at the altar, hauing a golden censer, and
b.REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints,
b.REV.8.5	And the Angel tooke the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast
b.REV.8.6	And the seuen Angels which had the seuen trumpets, prepared themselues to
b.REV.8.7	The first Angel sounded, and there followed haile, and fire mingled with
b.REV.8.8	And the second Angel sounded, and as it were a great mountaine burning with
b.REV.8.9	And the thirde part of the creatures which were in the Sea, and had life,
b.REV.9.1	And the fift Angel sounded, and I saw a starre fall from heauen vnto the
b.REV.9.10	And they had tayles like vnto Scorpions, and there were stings in their
b.REV.9.11	And they had a king ouer them, which is the Angel of the bottomlesse pit,
b.REV.9.12	One woe is past, and behold there come two woes more hereafter.
b.REV.9.13	And the sixt Angel sounded, and I heard a voyce from the foure hornes of ye
b.REV.9.14	Saying to the sixt Angel which had the trumpet, Loose the foure Angels which
b.REV.9.15	And the foure Angels were loosed, which were prepared for an houre, and a
b.REV.9.16	And the number of the armie of the horsemen were two hundred thousand
b.REV.9.17	And thus I sawe the horses in the vision, and them that sate on them, hauing
b.REV.9.18	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the
b.REV.9.19	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tailes: for their tailes were
b.REV.9.2	And hee opened the bottomelesse pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit,
b.REV.9.20	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet repented
b.REV.9.21	Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their
b.REV.9.3	And there came out of the smoke locusts vpon the earth, and vnto them was
b.REV.9.4	And it was commaunded them that they should not hurt the
b.REV.9.5	And to them it was giuen that they should not kill them, but that they should
b.REV.9.6	And in those daies shal men seeke death, and shall not finde it, and shall
b.REV.9.7	And the shapes of the Locusts were like vnto horses prepared vnto battell, and
b.REV.9.8	And they had haire as the haire of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of
b.REV.9.9	And they had brestplates, as it were brestplates of iron, and the sound of
b.ROM.10.1	Brethren, my hearts desire and prayer to God for
b.ROM.10.10	For with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteousnesse, and with the mouth
b.ROM.10.11	For the Scripture saith, Whosoeuer beleeueth on him, shall not bee ashamed.
b.ROM.10.12	For there is no difference betweene the Iew and the Greeke: for the same Lord
b.ROM.10.13	For whosoeuer shall call vpon the Name of the Lord, shall be saued.
b.ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on him in whom they haue not beleeued? And how shal
b.ROM.10.15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? As it is written: How
b.ROM.10.16	But they haue not all obeyed the Gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath
b.ROM.10.17	So then, faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
b.ROM.10.18	But I say, haue they not heard? yes verely, their sound went into all the
b.ROM.10.19	But I say, Did not
b.ROM.10.2	For I beare them record, that they haue a zeale of God, but not according to
b.ROM.10.20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not: I
b.ROM.10.21	But to
b.ROM.10.3	For they being ignorant of Gods righteousnesse, and going about to establish
b.ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnes to euery one that beleeueth.
b.ROM.10.5	For Moses describeth the righteousnesse which is of the Law, that the man
b.ROM.10.6	But the righteousnesse which is of faith, speaketh on this wise: Say not in
b.ROM.10.7	Or, Who shall descend into the deepe? That is to bring vp Christ againe from
b.ROM.10.8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
b.ROM.10.9	That if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt beleeue
b.ROM.1.1	Paul a seruant of Iesus Christ, called to bee an Apostle, separated vnto the
b.ROM.1.10	Making request, (if by any meanes now at length I might haue a prosperous
b.ROM.1.11	For I long to see you, that I may impart vnto you some spirituall gift, to
b.ROM.11.1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbidde. For I also am an
b.ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow downe their backe
b.ROM.11.11	I say then; Haue they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid. But rather
b.ROM.11.12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of
b.ROM.11.13	For I speake to you Gentiles, in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles,
b.ROM.11.14	If by any means I may prouoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might
b.ROM.11.15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world: what shal
b.ROM.11.16	For if the first fruite bee holy, the lumpe is also holy: and if the root be
b.ROM.11.17	And if some of the branches bee broken off, and thou being a wilde oliue tree
b.ROM.11.18	Boast not against the branches: but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root,
b.ROM.11.19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might bee graffed
b.ROM.1.12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both
b.ROM.11.2	God hath not cast away his people which hee foreknew. Wote yee not what the
b.ROM.11.20	Well: because of vnbeliefe they were broken off, and thou standest by fayth.
b.ROM.11.21	For if God spared not the natural branches, take heede least hee also spare
b.ROM.11.22	Beholde therefore the goodnesse and seueritie of God: on them which fell,
b.ROM.11.23	And they also, if they bide not still in vnbeliefe, shall be graffed in: for
b.ROM.11.24	For if thou wert cut out of the Oliue tree which is wilde by nature, and wert
b.ROM.11.25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should bee ignorant of this mysterie
b.ROM.11.26	And so all Israel shall be saued, as it is written, There shall come out of
b.ROM.11.27	For this is my couenant vnto them, when I shall take away their sinnes.
b.ROM.11.28	As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the
b.ROM.11.29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
b.ROM.1.13	Now I would not haue you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to
b.ROM.11.3	Lord, they haue killed thy Prophets, and digged downe thine Altars, and I am
b.ROM.11.30	For as yee in times past haue not beleeued God, yet haue now obtained mercy
b.ROM.11.31	Euen so haue these also now not beleeued, that through your mercy they also
b.ROM.11.32	For God hath concluded them all in vnbeliefe, that he might haue mercy vpon
b.ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! how
b.ROM.11.34	For who hath knowen the mind of the Lord, or who hath bene his counseller?
b.ROM.11.35	Or who hath first giuen to him, and it shall bee recompensed vnto him againe?
b.ROM.11.36	For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory for
b.ROM.1.14	I am debter both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians, both to the wise, and
b.ROM.11.4	But what saieth the answere of God vnto him? I haue reserued to my selfe seuen
b.ROM.1.15	So, as much as in mee is, I am ready to preach the Gospel to you that are at
b.ROM.11.5	Euen so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the
b.ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the Gopel of Christ: for it is the power of God vnto
b.ROM.11.6	And if by grace, then is it no more of workes: otherwise grace is no more
b.ROM.1.17	For therein is the righteousnesse of God reueiled from faith to faith: as it
b.ROM.11.7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the
b.ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is reueiled from heauen against all vngodlinesse, and
b.ROM.11.8	According as it is written, God hath giuen them the spirit of slumber: eyes
b.ROM.1.19	Because that which may bee knowen of God, is manifest in them, for God hath
b.ROM.11.9	And Dauid sayth, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling
b.ROM.1.2	(Which he had promised afore by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures,)
b.ROM.1.20	For the inuisible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearely
b.ROM.1.21	Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were
b.ROM.12.1	I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that yee present your
b.ROM.12.10	Bee kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly loue, in honour
b.ROM.12.11	Not slouthfull in busines: feruent in spirit, seruing the Lord.
b.ROM.12.12	Reioycing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer.
b.ROM.12.13	Distributing to the necessitie of Saints; giuen to hospitalitie.
b.ROM.12.14	Blesse them which persecute you, blesse, and curse not.
b.ROM.12.15	Reioyce with them that doe reioice, and weepe with them that weepe.
b.ROM.12.16	Be of the same mind one towards another. Minde not high things, but
b.ROM.12.17	Recompence to no man euill for euill. Prouide things honest in the sight of
b.ROM.12.18	If it be possible, as much as lyeth in you, liue peaceably with all men.
b.ROM.12.19	Dearely beloued, auenge not your selues, but rather giue place vnto wrath:
b.ROM.1.22	Professing themselues to be wise, they became fooles:
b.ROM.12.2	And bee not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renuing of
b.ROM.12.20	Therefore if thine enemie hunger, feed him: if he thirst, giue him drink. For
b.ROM.12.21	Be not ouercome of euill, but ouercome euill with good.
b.ROM.1.23	And changed the glory of the vncorruptible God, into an image made like to
b.ROM.12.3	For I say, through the grace giuen vnto mee, to euery man that is among you,
b.ROM.1.24	Wherefore God also gaue them vp to vncleannesse, through the lusts of their
b.ROM.12.4	For as we haue many members in one body, and all members haue not the same
b.ROM.1.25	Who changed the trueth of God into a lye, and worshipped and serued the
b.ROM.12.5	So we being many are one bodie in Christ, and euery one members one of
b.ROM.1.26	For this cause God gaue them vp vnto vile affections: for euen their women
b.ROM.12.6	Hauing then gifts, differing according to the grace that is giuen to vs,
b.ROM.1.27	And likewise also the men, leauing the naturall vse of the woman, burned in
b.ROM.12.7	Or ministery, let vs wait, on our ministring: or hee that teacheth, on
b.ROM.1.28	And euen as they did not like to retaine God in their knowledge, God gaue
b.ROM.12.8	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giueth, let him doe it with
b.ROM.1.29	Being filled with all vnrighteousnes, fornication, wickednesse, couetousnes,
b.ROM.12.9	Let loue bee without dissimulation: abhorre that which is euill, cleaue to
b.ROM.1.3	Concerning his Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of
b.ROM.1.30	Backbiters, haters of God, despitefull, proude, boasters, inuenters of euill
b.ROM.1.31	Without vnderstanding, couenant breakers, without naturall affection,
b.ROM.13.1	Let euery soule bee subiect vnto the higher powers: For there is no power but
b.ROM.13.10	Loue worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore loue is the fulfilling of the
b.ROM.13.11	And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleepe:
b.ROM.13.12	The night is farre spent, the day is at hand: let vs therefore cast off the
b.ROM.13.13	Let vs walke honestly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkennesse, not in
b.ROM.13.14	But put yee on the Lord Iesus Christ, and make not prouision for the flesh,
b.ROM.1.32	Who knowing the iudgement of God, (that they which commit such things, are
b.ROM.13.2	Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and
b.ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to the euill. Wilt thou then
b.ROM.13.4	For hee is the minister of God to thee for good: but if thou do that which is
b.ROM.13.5	Wherfore ye must needs be subiect, not onely for wrath, but also for
b.ROM.13.6	For, for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are Gods ministers,
b.ROM.13.7	Render therfore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custome to
b.ROM.13.8	Owe no man any thing, but to loue one another: for hee that loueth another
b.ROM.13.9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not
b.ROM.1.4	And declared to be the Sonne of God, with power, according to the Spirit of
b.ROM.14.1	Him that is weake in the faith receiue you, but not to doubtfull disputations.
b.ROM.14.10	But why doest thou iudge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at nought thy
b.ROM.14.11	For it is written, As I liue, saith the Lord, euery knee shall bow to mee,
b.ROM.14.12	So then euery one of vs shall giue accompt of himselfe to God.
b.ROM.14.13	Let vs not therefore iudge one another any more: but iudge this rather, that
b.ROM.14.14	I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Iesus, that there is nothing vncleane of
b.ROM.14.15	But if thy brother be grieued with thy meate: now walkest thou not
b.ROM.14.16	Let not then your good be euill spoken of.
b.ROM.14.17	For the kingdome of God is not meat and drinke; but righteousnes, and peace,
b.ROM.14.18	For hee that in these things serueth Christ, is acceptable to God, and
b.ROM.14.19	Let vs therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things
b.ROM.14.2	For one beleeueth that he may eat all things: another who is weake, eateth
b.ROM.14.20	For meat, destroy not the worke of God: all things indeed are pure; but it is
b.ROM.14.21	It is good neither to eate flesh, nor to drinke wine, nor any thing whereby
b.ROM.14.22	Hast thou faith? haue it to thy selfe before God. Happie is he that
b.ROM.14.23	And hee that doubteth, is damned if hee eate, because hee eateth not of
b.ROM.14.3	Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and let not him which
b.ROM.14.4	Who art thou that iudgest an other mans seruant? To his owne master he
b.ROM.14.5	One man esteemeth one day aboue another: another esteemeth euery day alike.
b.ROM.14.6	He that regardeth a day, regardeth it vnto the Lord; and hee that regardeth
b.ROM.14.7	For none of vs liueth to himselfe, and no man dieth to himselfe.
b.ROM.14.8	For whether we liue, we liue vnto the Lord: and whether wee die, we die vnto
b.ROM.14.9	For to this ende Christ both died, and rose, and reuiued, that hee might be
b.ROM.1.5	By whom we haue receiued grace and Apostleship for obedience to the faith
b.ROM.15.1	Wee then that are strong, ought to beare the infirmities of the weake, and not
b.ROM.15.10	And againe he saith, Reioyce yee Gentiles with his people.
b.ROM.15.11	And againe, Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laud him all ye people.
b.ROM.15.12	And againe Esaias saith, There shal be a roote of Iesse, and he that shal
b.ROM.15.13	Nowe the God of hope fill you with all ioy and peace in beleeuing, that yee
b.ROM.15.14	And I my selfe also am perswaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full
b.ROM.15.15	Neuerthelesse, brethren, I haue written the more boldly vnto you, in some
b.ROM.15.16	That I should be the minister of Iesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministring the
b.ROM.15.17	I haue therfore whereof I may glory through Iesus Christ, in those things
b.ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speake of any of those things, which Christ hath not
b.ROM.15.19	Through mighty signes and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that
b.ROM.15.2	Let euery one of vs please his neighbour for his good to edification.
b.ROM.15.20	Yea, so haue I striued to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest
b.ROM.15.21	But as it is written, To whom hee was not spoken of, they shall see: and they
b.ROM.15.22	For which cause also I haue been much hindered from coming to you.
b.ROM.15.23	But now hauing no more place in these parts, and hauing a great desire these
b.ROM.15.24	Whensoeuer I take my iourney into Spaine, I will come to you: for I trust to
b.ROM.15.25	But now I goe vnto Hierusalem, to minister vnto the Saints.
b.ROM.15.26	For it hath pleased them of
b.ROM.15.27	It hath pleased them verely, and their detters they are. For if the Gentiles
b.ROM.15.28	When therefore I haue performed this, and hane sealed to them this fruit, I
b.ROM.15.29	And I am sure that when I come vnto you, I shall come in the fulnes of the
b.ROM.15.3	For euen Christ pleased not himselfe, but as it is written, The reproches of
b.ROM.15.30	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Iesus Christs sake, and for the
b.ROM.15.31	That I may bee deliuered from them that do not beleeue in Iudea, and that my
b.ROM.15.32	That I may come vnto you with ioy by the will of God, and may with you be
b.ROM.15.33	Now the God of peace bee with you all. Amen.
b.ROM.15.4	For whatsoeuer things were written aforetime, were written for our learning,
b.ROM.15.5	Now the God of patience and consolation graunt you to be like minded one
b.ROM.15.6	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God, euen the Father of our
b.ROM.15.7	Wherfore receiue yee one another, as Christ also receiued vs, to the glory of
b.ROM.15.8	Now I say, that Iesus Christ was a Minister of the circumcision for the trueth
b.ROM.15.9	And that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercie, as it is written, For
b.ROM.1.6	Among whom are ye also the called of Iesus Christ.
b.ROM.16.1	I commend vnto you Phebe our sister, which is a seruant of the Church which is
b.ROM.16.10	Salute Appelles approoued in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus
b.ROM.16.11	Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the houshold of Narcissus,
b.ROM.16.12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloued
b.ROM.16.13	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
b.ROM.16.14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which
b.ROM.16.15	Salute Philologus &amp; Iulia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all
b.ROM.16.16	Salute one another with an holy kisse. The Churches of Christ salute you.
b.ROM.16.17	Now I beseech you, brethren, marke them which cause diuisions and offences,
b.ROM.16.18	For they that are such, serue not our Lord Iesus Christ, but their owne
b.ROM.16.19	For your obedience is come abroad vnto all men. I am glad therefore on your
b.ROM.16.2	That ye receiue her in the Lord as becommeth Saints, and that ye assist her in
b.ROM.16.20	And the God of peace shal bruise Satan vnder your feete shortly. The grace of
b.ROM.16.21	Timotheus my worke-fellow, and Lucius, and Iason, and Sosipater my kinsemen
b.ROM.16.22	I Tertius who wrote this Epistle, salute you in the Lord.
b.ROM.16.23	Gaius mine hoste, and of the whole Church, saluteth you. Erastus the
b.ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
b.ROM.16.25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my Gospel, and the
b.ROM.16.26	But now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to
b.ROM.16.27	To God, onely wise, bee glorie through Iesus Christ, for euer. Amen.
b.ROM.16.3	Greete Priscilla and
b.ROM.16.4	(Who haue for my life laid downe their owne neckes: vnto whome not onely I
b.ROM.16.5	Likewise greet the Church that is in their house. Salute my welbeloued
b.ROM.16.6	Greete Marie, who bestowed much labour on vs.
b.ROM.16.7	Salute Andronicus and Iunia my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, who are of
b.ROM.16.8	Greet Amplias my beloued in the Lord.
b.ROM.16.9	Salute Urbane our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloued.
b.ROM.1.7	To all that be in
b.ROM.1.8	First I thanke my God through Iesus Christ for you all, that your faith is
b.ROM.1.9	For God is my witnesse, whom I serue with my spirit in the Gospel of his Sonne,
b.ROM.2.1	Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoeuer thou art that iudgest: for
b.ROM.2.10	But glory, honour, and peace, to euery man that worketh good, to the Iew
b.ROM.2.11	For there is no respect of persons with God.
b.ROM.2.12	For as many as haue sinned without Law, shall also perish without Law: and as
b.ROM.2.13	(For not the hearers of the Law are iust before God, but the doers of the Law
b.ROM.2.14	For when the Gentiles which haue not the Law, doe by nature the things
b.ROM.2.15	Which shew the worke of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience
b.ROM.2.16	In the day when God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ, according
b.ROM.2.17	Behold, thou art called a Iew, and restest in the Law, and makest thy boast
b.ROM.2.18	And knowest his will, and approuest the things that are more excellent, being
b.ROM.2.19	And art confident that thou thy selfe art a guide of the blinde, a light of
b.ROM.2.2	But wee are sure that the iudgement of God is according to trueth, against
b.ROM.2.20	An instructour of the foolish, a teacher of babes: which hast the forme of
b.ROM.2.21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thy selfe? thou that
b.ROM.2.22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adulterie, doest thou commit
b.ROM.2.23	Thou that makest thy boast of the Law, through breaking the Law dishonourest
b.ROM.2.24	For the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is
b.ROM.2.25	For Circumcision verily profiteth if thou keepe the Law: but if thou be a
b.ROM.2.26	Therefore, if the vncircumcision keepe the righteousnesse of the Law, shall
b.ROM.2.27	And shall not vncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the Law, iudge
b.ROM.2.28	For hee is not a Iew, which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumcision,
b.ROM.2.29	But he is a Iew which is one inwardly, and Circumcision is, that of the
b.ROM.2.3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that iudgest them which doe such things, and
b.ROM.2.4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodnesse, and forbearance, and long
b.ROM.2.5	But after thy hardnesse, and impenitent heart, treasurest vp vnto thy selfe
b.ROM.2.6	Who will render to euery man according to his deedes:
b.ROM.2.7	To them, who by patient continuance in well doing, seeke for glorie, and
b.ROM.2.8	But vnto them that are contentious, &amp; doe not obey the trueth, but obey
b.ROM.2.9	Tribulation, and anguish vpon euery soule of man that doeth euill, of the Iew
b.ROM.3.1	What aduantage then hath the Iew? or what profit is there of Circumcision?
b.ROM.3.10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one:
b.ROM.3.11	There is none that vnderstandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
b.ROM.3.12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become vnprofitable,
b.ROM.3.13	Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues they haue vsed deceit,
b.ROM.3.14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitternesse:
b.ROM.3.15	Their feet are swift to shed blood.
b.ROM.3.16	Destruction &amp; misery are in their wayes:
b.ROM.3.17	And the way of peace haue they not knowen.
b.ROM.3.18	There is no feare of God before their eyes.
b.ROM.3.19	Now we know that what things soeuer the Law saith, it saith to them who are
b.ROM.3.2	Much euery way: chiefly, because that vnto them were committed the Oracles of
b.ROM.3.20	Therefore by the deedes of the Law, there shall no flesh be iustified in his
b.ROM.3.21	But nowe the righteousnesse of God without the Lawe is manifested, being
b.ROM.3.22	Euen the righteousnesse of God, which is by faith of Iesus Christ vnto all,
b.ROM.3.23	For all haue sinned, and come short of the glory of God,
b.ROM.3.24	Being iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Iesus
b.ROM.3.25	Whom God hath set forth to bee a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to
b.ROM.3.26	To declare, I say, at this time his righteousnesse: that hee might bee iust,
b.ROM.3.27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay: but by
b.ROM.3.28	Therefore wee conclude, that a man is iustified by faith, without the deeds
b.ROM.3.29	Is he the God of the Iewes only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the
b.ROM.3.3	For what if some did not beleeue? shall their vnbeliefe make the faith of God
b.ROM.3.30	Seeing it is one God which shal iustifie the circumcision by faith, and
b.ROM.3.31	Doe we then make void the lawe through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish
b.ROM.3.4	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but euery man a lier, as it is written, That
b.ROM.3.5	But if our vnrighteousnesse commend the righteousnesse of God, what shall we
b.ROM.3.6	God forbid: for then how shall God iudge the world?
b.ROM.3.7	For if the trueth of God hath more abounded through my lye vnto his glory; why
b.ROM.3.8	And not rather as wee be slanderously reported, and as some affirme that we
b.ROM.3.9	What then? are wee better then they? No in no wise: for we haue before proued
b.ROM.4.1	What shall we say then, that Abraham our father, as perteining to the flesh,
b.ROM.4.10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in vncircumcision?
b.ROM.4.11	And hee receiued the signe of circumcision, a seale of the righteousnesse of
b.ROM.4.12	And the father of circumcision, to them who are not of the circumcision onely,
b.ROM.4.13	For the promise that he should be the heire of the world, was not to Abraham,
b.ROM.4.14	For if they which are of the law be heires, faith is made voide, and the
b.ROM.4.15	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no Lawe is, there is no
b.ROM.4.16	Therefore it is of faith, that it might bee by grace; to the ende the promise
b.ROM.4.17	(As it is written, I haue made thee a father of many nations) before him whom
b.ROM.4.18	Who against hope, beleeued in hope, that hee might become the father of many
b.ROM.4.19	And being not weake in faith, hee considered not his owne body now dead, when
b.ROM.4.2	For if Abraham were iustified by workes, hee hath whereof to glory, but not
b.ROM.4.20	Hee staggered not at the promise of God through vnbeliefe: but was strong in
b.ROM.4.21	And being fully perswaded, that what he had promised, he was able also to
b.ROM.4.22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousnesse.
b.ROM.4.23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him:
b.ROM.4.24	But for vs also, to whome it shall bee imputed, if wee beleeue on him that
b.ROM.4.25	Who was deliuered for our offences, and was raised againe for our
b.ROM.4.3	For what saith the Scripture? Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted vnto
b.ROM.4.4	Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
b.ROM.4.5	But to him that worketh not, but beleeueth on him that iustifieth the vngodly;
b.ROM.4.6	Euen as Dauid also describeth the blessednesse of the man, vnto whom God
b.ROM.4.7	Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose sinnes are
b.ROM.4.8	Blessed is the man to whome the Lord will not impute sinne.
b.ROM.4.9	Commeth this blessednes then vpon the circumcision onely, or vpon the
b.ROM.5.1	Therefore being iustified by faith, wee haue peace with God, through our Lord
b.ROM.5.10	For if when wee were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his
b.ROM.5.11	And not onely so, but wee also ioy in God, through our Lorde Iesus Christ, by
b.ROM.5.12	Wherefore, as by one man sinne entred into the world, and death by sin: and
b.ROM.5.13	For vntill the Law sinne was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there
b.ROM.5.14	Neuertheles, death reigned from Adam to Moses, euen ouer them that had not
b.ROM.5.15	But not as the offence, so also is the free gift: for if through the offence
b.ROM.5.16	And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the iudgement was
b.ROM.5.17	For if by one mans offence, death raigned by one, much more they which
b.ROM.5.18	Therfore as by the offence of one, iudgment came vpon all men to
b.ROM.5.19	For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners: so by the obedience
b.ROM.5.2	By whom also wee haue accesse by faith, into this grace wherein wee stand, and
b.ROM.5.20	Moreouer, the Lawe entred, that the offence might abound: but where sinne
b.ROM.5.21	That as sinne hath reigned vnto death; euen so might grace reigne thorow
b.ROM.5.3	And not onely so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation
b.ROM.5.4	And patience, experience: and experience, hope:
b.ROM.5.5	And hope maketh not ashamed, because the loue of God is shed abroad in our
b.ROM.5.6	For when wee were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the
b.ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peraduenture for a good
b.ROM.5.8	But God commendeth his loue towards vs, in that, while we were yet sinners,
b.ROM.5.9	Much more then being now iustified by his blood, we shalbe saued from wrath
b.ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? shall wee continue in sinne: that grace may abound?
b.ROM.6.10	For in that he dyed, he dyed vnto sinne once: but in that hee liueth, hee
b.ROM.6.11	Likewise reckon yee also your selues to be dead indeed vnto sinne: but aliue
b.ROM.6.12	Let not sinne reigne therfore in your mortall body, that ye should obey it in
b.ROM.6.13	Neither yeeld yee your members as instruments of vnrighteousnes vnto sinne:
b.ROM.6.14	For sinne shall not haue dominion ouer you, for yee are not vnder the Law,
b.ROM.6.15	What then? shal we sinne, because wee are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace?
b.ROM.6.16	Know ye not, that to whom yee yeeld your selues seruants to obey, his
b.ROM.6.17	But God bee thanked, that yee were the seruants of sinne: but ye haue obeyed
b.ROM.6.18	Being then made free from sinne, yee became the seruants of righteousnesse.
b.ROM.6.19	I speake after the maner of men, because of the infirmitie of your flesh: for
b.ROM.6.2	God forbid: how shall wee that are dead to sinne, liue any longer therein?
b.ROM.6.20	For when yee were the seruants of sinne ye were free from righteousnesse.
b.ROM.6.21	What fruit had yee then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? for the
b.ROM.6.22	But now being made free from sinne, and become seruants to God, yee haue your
b.ROM.6.23	For the wages of sinne is death: but the gift of God is eternall life,
b.ROM.6.3	Know ye not, that so many of vs as were baptized into Iesus Christ, were
b.ROM.6.4	Therefore wee are buryed with him by baptisme into death, that like as Christ
b.ROM.6.5	For if we haue bene planted together in the likenesse of his death: wee shalbe
b.ROM.6.6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the bodie of sinne
b.ROM.6.7	For he that is dead, is freed from sinne.
b.ROM.6.8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we beleeue that we shal also liue with him:
b.ROM.6.9	Knowing that Christ being raysed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no
b.ROM.7.1	Know ye not, brethren (for I speake to them that knowe the Lawe) how that the
b.ROM.7.10	And the commandement which was ordained to life, I found to be vnto death.
b.ROM.7.11	For sinne taking occasion by the commandement, deceiued me, and by it slew
b.ROM.7.12	Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Commandement holy, and iust, and good.
b.ROM.7.13	Was that then which is good, made death vnto me? God forbid. But sinne, that
b.ROM.7.14	For wee know that the Law is spirituall: but I am carnall, sold vnder sinne.
b.ROM.7.15	For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not, but what I
b.ROM.7.16	If then I doe that which I would not, I consent vnto the Law, that it is
b.ROM.7.17	Now then, it is no more I that doe it: but sinne that dwelleth in me.
b.ROM.7.18	For I know, that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing. For to
b.ROM.7.19	For the good that I would, I do not: but the euill which I would not, that I
b.ROM.7.2	For the woman which hath an husbaud, is bound by the law to her husband, so
b.ROM.7.20	Now if I doe that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sinne that
b.ROM.7.21	I find then a Law, that when I would do good, euil is present with me.
b.ROM.7.22	For I delight in the Lawe of God, after the inward man.
b.ROM.7.23	But I see another Lawe in my members, warring against the Lawe of my minde,
b.ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am: who shall deliuer me from the body of this death?
b.ROM.7.25	I thanke God through Iesus Christ our Lord. So then, with the mind I my self
b.ROM.7.3	So then if while her husband liueth, shee be married to another man, shee
b.ROM.7.4	Wherefore my brethren, yee also are become dead to the law by the body of
b.ROM.7.5	For when wee were in the flesh, the motions of sinnes which were by the law,
b.ROM.7.6	But now wee are deliuered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held,
b.ROM.7.7	What shall wee say then? is the law sinne? God forbid. Nay, I had not knowen
b.ROM.7.8	But sinne taking occasion by the commaundement, wrought in me all maner of
b.ROM.7.9	For I was aliue without the Law once, but when the commandement came, sinne
b.ROM.8.1	There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus, who
b.ROM.8.10	And if Christ in you, the body is dead because of sinne: but the spirit is
b.ROM.8.11	But if the spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead, dwell in you: he
b.ROM.8.12	Therfore brethren, we are detters, not to the flesh, to liue after the flesh.
b.ROM.8.13	For if ye liue after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the spirit
b.ROM.8.14	For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sonnes of God.
b.ROM.8.15	For ye haue not receiued the spirit of bondage againe to feare: but ye haue
b.ROM.8.16	The spirit it selfe beareth witnes with our spirit, that we are the children
b.ROM.8.17	And if children, then heires, heires of God, and ioynt heires with Christ: if
b.ROM.8.18	For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be
b.ROM.8.19	For the earnest expectation of the creature, waiteth for the manifestation of
b.ROM.8.2	For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Iesus, hath made me free from the
b.ROM.8.20	For the creature was made subiect to vanitie, not willingly, but by reason of
b.ROM.8.21	Because the creature it selfe also shall bee deliuered from the bondage of
b.ROM.8.22	For wee know that the whole creation groaneth, and trauaileth in paine
b.ROM.8.23	And not only they, but our selues also which haue the first fruites of the
b.ROM.8.24	For wee are saued by hope: but hope that is seene, is not hope: for what a
b.ROM.8.25	But if wee hope for that wee see not, then doe wee with patience waite for
b.ROM.8.26	Likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what wee
b.ROM.8.27	And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the minde of the spirit,
b.ROM.8.28	And wee know that all things worke together for good, to them that loue God,
b.ROM.8.29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the
b.ROM.8.3	For what the law could not doe, in that it was weake through the flesh, God
b.ROM.8.30	Moreouer, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called,
b.ROM.8.31	What shall wee then say to these things? If God be for vs, who can bee
b.ROM.8.32	He that spared not his owne son, but deliuered him vp for vs all: how shall
b.ROM.8.33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that
b.ROM.8.34	Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen
b.ROM.8.35	Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? shall tribulation, or
b.ROM.8.36	(As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long, wee are
b.ROM.8.37	Nay in all these things wee are more then conquerours, through him that loued
b.ROM.8.38	For I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
b.ROM.8.39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shalbe able to separate vs
b.ROM.8.4	That the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in vs, who walke not
b.ROM.8.5	For they that are after the flesh, doe minde the things of the flesh: but they
b.ROM.8.6	For to be carnally minded, is death: but to be spiritually minded, is life and
b.ROM.8.7	Because the carnall minde is enmitie against God: for it is not subiect to the
b.ROM.8.8	So then they that are in the flesh, cannot please God.
b.ROM.8.9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of
b.ROM.9.1	I say the trueth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing mee witnesse
b.ROM.9.10	And not onely this, but when Rebecca also had conceiued by one, euen by our
b.ROM.9.11	(For the children being not yet borne, neither hauing done any good or euil,
b.ROM.9.12	It was said vnto her, The elder shall serue the yonger.
b.ROM.9.13	As it is written, Iacob haue I loued, but Esau haue I hated.
b.ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? Is there vnrighteousnes with God? God forbid.
b.ROM.9.15	For hee saith to Moses, I will haue mercy on whom I wil haue mercie, and I
b.ROM.9.16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
b.ROM.9.17	For the Scripture saith vnto Pharaoh, Euen for this same purpose haue I
b.ROM.9.18	Therefore hath hee mercie on whom hee will haue mercy, and whom he will, he
b.ROM.9.19	Thou wilt say then vnto mee; Why doeth he yet find fault? For who hath
b.ROM.9.2	That I haue great heauinesse, and continuall sorrow in my heart.
b.ROM.9.20	Nay but O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed
b.ROM.9.21	Hath not the potter power ouer the clay, of the same lumpe, to make one
b.ROM.9.22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, &amp; to make his power knowen,
b.ROM.9.23	And that he might make knowen the riches of his glory on the vessels of
b.ROM.9.24	Euen vs whom hee hath called, not of the Iewes onely, but also of the
b.ROM.9.25	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my
b.ROM.9.26	And it shall come to passe, that in the place where it was saide vnto them,
b.ROM.9.27	Esaias also crieth concerning
b.ROM.9.28	For he will finish the worke, and cut it short in righteousnesse: because a
b.ROM.9.29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabboth had left vs a seed, we
b.ROM.9.3	For I could wish that my selfe were accursed from Christ, for my brethren my
b.ROM.9.30	What shall wee say then? That the Gentiles which followed not after
b.ROM.9.31	But
b.ROM.9.32	Wherefore? because they sought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works
b.ROM.9.33	As it is written, Beholde, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone, and rocke of
b.ROM.9.4	Who are Israelites: to whom perteineth the adoption, and the glory, and the
b.ROM.9.5	Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is
b.ROM.9.6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all
b.ROM.9.7	Neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children: but in
b.ROM.9.8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children
b.ROM.9.9	For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall haue
b.RUT.1.1	Nowe it came to passe in the dayes when ye Iudges ruled, that there was a famine
b.RUT.1.10	And they said vnto her, Surely wee will returne with thee, vnto thy people.
b.RUT.1.11	And Naomi said, Turne againe, my daughters: why will you goe with mee? Are
b.RUT.1.12	Turne againe, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to haue an husband:
b.RUT.1.13	Would ye tary for them till they were growen? would ye stay for them from
b.RUT.1.14	And they lift vp their voyce, and wept againe: and Orpah kissed her mother in
b.RUT.1.15	And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone backe vnto her people, and
b.RUT.1.16	And Ruth said, Intreate mee not to leaue thee, or to returne from following
b.RUT.1.17	Where thou diest, wil I die, and there will I bee buried: the Lord doe so to
b.RUT.1.18	When shee sawe that shee was stedfastly minded to goe with her, then shee
b.RUT.1.19	So they two went vntill they came to Bethlehem: And it came to passe when
b.RUT.1.2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi, and
b.RUT.1.20	And she said vnto them, Call me not Naomi; call mee Mara: for the Almightie
b.RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the Lord hath bought me home againe emptie: Why then
b.RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitesse her daughter in law with her,
b.RUT.1.3	And Elimelech Naomies husband died, and shee was left, and her two sonnes;
b.RUT.1.4	And they tooke them wiues of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah,
b.RUT.1.5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them, and the woman was left of her
b.RUT.1.6	Then shee arose with her daughters in law, that shee might returne from the
b.RUT.1.7	Wherefore she went foorth out of the place where she was, and her two
b.RUT.1.8	Aud Naomi said vnto her two daughters in law, Goe, returne each to her mothers
b.RUT.1.9	The Lord graunt you, that you may finde rest each of you in the house of her
b.RUT.2.1	And Naomi had a kinseman of her husbands, a mighty man of wealth, of the
b.RUT.2.10	Then she fel on her face, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and said vnto
b.RUT.2.11	And Boaz answered and said vnto her, It hath fully bene shewed me, all that
b.RUT.2.12	The Lord recompense thy worke, and a full reward be giuen thee of the Lord
b.RUT.2.13	Then she said, Let me finde fauour in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast
b.RUT.2.14	And Boaz sayde vnto her, At meale time come thou hither, and eate of the
b.RUT.2.15	And when shee was risen vp to gleane, Boaz commanded his young men, saying,
b.RUT.2.16	And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leaue them
b.RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field vntill euen, and beat out that she had gleaned:
b.RUT.2.18	And shee tooke it vp, and went into the citie: and her mother in lawe saw
b.RUT.2.19	And her mother in law said vnto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and
b.RUT.2.2	And Ruth the Moabitesse saide vnto Naomi, Let me now goe to the field, and
b.RUT.2.20	And Naomi said vnto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord, who hath
b.RUT.2.21	And Ruth the Moabitesse said, He said vnto me also, Thou shalt keepe fast by
b.RUT.2.22	And Naomi said vnto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that
b.RUT.2.23	So shee kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to gleane, vnto the end of barley
b.RUT.2.3	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her
b.RUT.2.4	And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said vnto the reapers, The Lord bee
b.RUT.2.5	Then said Boaz vnto his seruant, that was set ouer the reapers, Whose damosell
b.RUT.2.6	And the seruaunt that was set ouer the reapers, answered and said, It is the
b.RUT.2.7	And she said, I pray you, let mee gleane and gather after the reapers amongst
b.RUT.2.8	Then said Boaz vnto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Goe not to gleane in
b.RUT.2.9	Let thine eyes be on the field that they doe reape, and go thou after them:
b.RUT.3.1	Then Naomi her mother in law said vnto her, My daughter, shal I not seeke rest
b.RUT.3.10	And hee said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou hast shewed
b.RUT.3.11	And now my daughter, feare not, I will doe to thee all that thou requirest:
b.RUT.3.12	And now it is true, that I am thy neare kinseman: howbeit there is a kinseman
b.RUT.3.13	Tary this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if hee will performe
b.RUT.3.14	And shee lay at his feete vntill the morning: and she rose vp before one
b.RUT.3.15	Also he said, Bring the vaile that thou hast vpon thee, and holde it. And
b.RUT.3.16	And when shee came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter?
b.RUT.3.17	And she said, These sixe measures of barley gaue he me, for he said to me, Go
b.RUT.3.18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, vntill thou know how the matter will
b.RUT.3.2	And now is not Boaz of our kinred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he
b.RUT.3.3	Wash thy selfe therefore, and annoint thee, and put thy raiment vpon thee, and
b.RUT.3.4	And it shall be when hee lieth downe, that thou shalt marke the place where
b.RUT.3.5	And shee said vnto her, All that thou sayest vnto me, I will doe.
b.RUT.3.6	And she went downe vnto the floore, and did according to all that her mother
b.RUT.3.7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunke, and his heart was merrie, hee went to lie
b.RUT.3.8	And it came to passe at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himselfe:
b.RUT.3.9	And hee said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread
b.RUT.4.1	Then went Boaz vp to the gate, and sate him downe there: and beholde, the
b.RUT.4.10	Moreouer, Ruth the Moabitesse, the wife of Mahlon, haue I purchased to be my
b.RUT.4.11	And all the people that were in the gate, and the Elders said, Wee are
b.RUT.4.12	And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, ( whom Tamar bare vnto to
b.RUT.4.13	So Boaz tooke Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in vnto her, the
b.RUT.4.14	And the women said vnto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord which hath not left thee
b.RUT.4.15	And he shalbe vnto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old
b.RUT.4.16	And Naomi tooke the childe, and laid it in her bosome, and became nurse vnto
b.RUT.4.17	And the women her neighbours gaue it a name, saying, There is a sonne borne
b.RUT.4.18	Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begate Hezron,
b.RUT.4.19	And Hezron begate Ram, and Ram begate Amminadab,
b.RUT.4.2	And hee tooke ten men of the Elders of the citie, and said, Sit ye downe here.
b.RUT.4.20	And Amminadab begate Nahshon, and Nahshon begate Salmon,
b.RUT.4.21	And Salmon begate Boaz, and Boaz begate Obed,
b.RUT.4.22	And Obed begat Iesse, and Iesse begate Dauid.
b.RUT.4.3	And he said vnto the kinseman: Naomi that is come againe out of the countrey
b.RUT.4.4	And I thought to aduertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and
b.RUT.4.5	Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must
b.RUT.4.6	And the kinseman said, I cannot redeeme it for my selfe, lest I marre mine
b.RUT.4.7	Now this was the maner in former time in Israel, concerning redeeming and
b.RUT.4.8	Therfore the kinseman said vnto Boaz, Buy it for thee: so he drew off his
b.RUT.4.9	And Boaz saide vnto the Elders, and vnto all the people, Ye are witnesses this

b.ZEC.11.1	Open thy doores, O Lebanon, that the fire may deuoure thy cedars.
b.ZEC.11.10	And I tooke my staffe, euen Beautie, and cut it asunder, that I might breake
b.ZEC.11.11	And it was broken in that day: and so the poore of the flocke that waited
b.ZEC.11.12	And I said vnto them, If yee thinke good, giue me my price: and if not,
b.ZEC.11.13	And the Lord said vnto mee, Cast it vnto the potter: a goodly price, that I
b.ZEC.11.14	Then I cut asunder mine other staffe, euen Bands, that I might break the
b.ZEC.11.15	And the Lord said vnto me, Take vnto thee yet the instruments of a foolish
b.ZEC.11.16	For loe, I wil raise vp a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those
b.ZEC.11.17	Woe to the idoll shepheard that leaueth the flocke: the sword shall be vpon
b.ZEC.1.12	Then the Angel of the Lord answered, and said, O Lord of hosts, how long wilt
b.ZEC.11.2	Howle firre tree, for the cedar is fallen; because all the mighty are spoiled;
b.ZEC.1.13	And the Lord answered the Angel that talked with me, with good words, and
b.ZEC.11.3	There is a voyce of the howling of the shepheards; for their glory is spoiled:
b.ZEC.1.14	So the Angel that communed with me, said vnto me; Cry thou, saying; Thus
b.ZEC.11.4	Thus saith the Lord my God; Feede the flocke of the slaughter;
b.ZEC.1.15	And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was
b.ZEC.11.5	Whose possessours slay them, and hold themselues not guiltie: and they that
b.ZEC.1.16	Therefore thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Ierusalem with mercies: my
b.ZEC.11.6	For I will no more pitie the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: but loe,
b.ZEC.1.17	Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hostes, My cities through prosperitie
b.ZEC.11.7	And I will feede the flocke of slaughter, euen you, O poore of the flock: and
b.ZEC.1.18	Then lift I vp mine eyes, and saw, and behold foure hornes.
b.ZEC.11.8	Three shepheards also I cut off in one moneth, and my soule loathed them, and
b.ZEC.1.19	And I said vnto the Angel that talked with me; What be these? and he answered
b.ZEC.11.9	Then said I, I will not feede you: that that dieth, let it die: and that that
b.ZEC.1.2	The Lord hath bene sore displeased with your fathers.
b.ZEC.1.20	And the Lord shewed mee foure carpenters.
b.ZEC.1.21	Then said I, What come these to doe? And hee spake, saying, These are the
b.ZEC.12.1	The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel, saith the Lord, which
b.ZEC.12.10	And I wil powre vpon the house of Dauid, and vpon the inhabitants of
b.ZEC.12.11	In that day shall there bee a great mourning in Ierusalem, as the mourning of
b.ZEC.12.12	And the land shal mourne, euery familie apart, the familie of the house of
b.ZEC.12.13	The familie of the house of Leui apart, and their wiues apart: the familie of
b.ZEC.12.14	All the families that remaine, euery family apart, &amp; their wiues apart.
b.ZEC.12.2	Behold, I will make Ierusalem a cup of trembling vnto all the people round
b.ZEC.12.3	And in that day will I make Ierusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all
b.ZEC.12.4	In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite euery horse with astonishment, and
b.ZEC.12.5	And the gouernours of Iudah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of
b.ZEC.12.6	In that day will I make the gouernours of Iudah like a harth of fire among the
b.ZEC.12.7	The Lord also shall saue the tents of Iudah first, that the glory of the house
b.ZEC.12.8	In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and he that is
b.ZEC.12.9	And it shall come to passe in that day, that I will seeke to destroy all the
b.ZEC.1.3	Therefore say thou vnto them, Thus saith the Lord of hostes; Turne ye vnto me,
b.ZEC.13.1	In that day there shalbe a fountaine opened to the house of Dauid, and to the
b.ZEC.13.2	And it shal come to passe in that day, saith the Lord of hostes, that I will
b.ZEC.13.3	And it shal come to passe that when any shall yet prophecie, then his father
b.ZEC.13.4	And it shall come to passe in that day, that the prophets shalbe ashamed euery
b.ZEC.13.5	But he shal say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman: for man taught me to
b.ZEC.13.6	And one shal say vnto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then hee
b.ZEC.13.7	Awake, O sword, against my shepheard, and against the man that is my fellow,
b.ZEC.13.8	And it shall come to passe, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts
b.ZEC.13.9	And I will bring the thirde part through the fire, and wil refine them as
b.ZEC.1.4	Be ye not as your fathers, vnto whom the former Prophets haue cried, saying,
b.ZEC.14.1	Beholde, the day of the Lord commeth, and thy spoile shall be diuided in the
b.ZEC.14.10	All the land shall be turned as a plaine from Geba to Rimmon, South of
b.ZEC.14.11	And men shall dwell in it, and there shalbe no more vtter destruction: but
b.ZEC.14.12	And this shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite all the people,
b.ZEC.14.13	And it shall come to passe in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord
b.ZEC.14.14	And Iudah also shall fight at Ierusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen
b.ZEC.14.15	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camell, and of
b.ZEC.14.16	And it shall come to passe that euery one that is left of all the nations
b.ZEC.14.17	And it shall be, that who so will not come vp of all the families of the
b.ZEC.14.18	And if the family of Egypt goe not vp, and come not, that haue no raine:
b.ZEC.14.19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that
b.ZEC.14.2	For I wil gather all nations against Ierusalem to battell, and the citie shall
b.ZEC.14.20	In that day shall there be vpon the bels of the horses, Holines Unto The
b.ZEC.14.21	Yea, euery pot in Ierusalem and in Iudah shall bee Holinesse vnto the Lord of
b.ZEC.14.3	Then shall the Lord goe forth and fight against those nations, as when he
b.ZEC.14.4	And his feet shall stand in that day vpon the mount of Oliues, which is before
b.ZEC.14.5	And ye shal flee to the valley of the mountaines: for the valley of the
b.ZEC.14.6	And it shall come to passe in that day, that the light shall not be cleare,
b.ZEC.14.7	But it shall be one day, which shalbe knowen to the Lord, not day nor night:
b.ZEC.14.8	And it shal be in that day, that liuing waters shall goe out from Ierusalem:
b.ZEC.14.9	And the Lord shall be King ouer all the earth: in that day shal there be one
b.ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, doe they liue for euer?
b.ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my seruants the Prophets, did
b.ZEC.1.7	Upon the foure and twentieth day of the eleuenth moneth, which is the moneth
b.ZEC.1.8	I saw by night, and behold a man riding vpon a red horse, and he stood among
b.ZEC.1.9	Then said I, O my Lord, what are these? And the Angel that talked with me,
b.ZEC.2.1	I lift vp mine eyes againe, and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring
b.ZEC.2.10	Sing and reioyce, O daughter of Zion: for loe, I come, and I will dwell in
b.ZEC.2.11	And many nations shalbe ioyned to the Lord in that day, and shall be my
b.ZEC.2.12	And the Lord shall inherite Iudah his portion in the holy land, and shall
b.ZEC.2.13	Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord: for he is raised vp out of his holy
b.ZEC.2.2	Then said I, Whither goest thou? And hee said vnto me, To measure Ierusalem,
b.ZEC.2.3	And behold, the Angel that talked with me, went foorth, and another Angel went
b.ZEC.2.4	And said vnto him, Run, speake to this young man, saying; Ierusalem shall be
b.ZEC.2.5	For I, saith the Lord, will be vnto her a wall of fire round about, and will
b.ZEC.2.6	Ho, ho, come foorth, and flee from the land of the North, saith the Lord: for
b.ZEC.2.7	Deliuer thy selfe, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
b.ZEC.2.8	For thus sayth the Lord of hostes, After the glory hath he sent me vnto the
b.ZEC.2.9	For behold, I will shake mine hand vpon them, and they shall bee a spoile to
b.ZEC.3.1	And he shewed me Ioshua the high Priest, standing before the Angel of the
b.ZEC.3.10	In that day, saith the Lord of hostes, shal ye call euery man his neighbour
b.ZEC.3.2	And the Lord said vnto Satan; The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, euen the Lord
b.ZEC.3.3	Now Ioshua was clothed with filthie garments, and stood before the Angel.
b.ZEC.3.4	And he answered, and spake vnto those that stood before him, saying, Take away
b.ZEC.3.5	And I said, Let them set a faire mitre vpon his head. So they set a faire
b.ZEC.3.6	And the Angel of the Lord protested vnto Ioshua, saying;
b.ZEC.3.7	Thus sayth the Lord of hosts, If thou wilt walke in my wayes, and if thou wilt
b.ZEC.3.8	Heare now, O Ioshua the high Priest, thou and thy fellowes that sit before
b.ZEC.3.9	For behold the stone that I haue layd before Ioshua: vpon one stone shall be
b.ZEC.4.1	And the Angell that talked with me, came againe and waked me, as a man that is
b.ZEC.4.10	For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall reioyce and
b.ZEC.4.11	Then answered I, and said vnto him; What are these two oliue trees vpon the
b.ZEC.4.12	And I answered againe and said vnto him, What be these two oliue branches,
b.ZEC.4.13	And hee answered mee and said; Knowest thou not what these be? and I said,
b.ZEC.4.14	Then said he; These are the two annointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the
b.ZEC.4.2	And said vnto mee, What seest thou? and I said, I haue looked, and behold a
b.ZEC.4.3	And two Oliue trees by it, one vpon the right side of the bowle, and the other
b.ZEC.4.4	So I answered and spake to the Angell that talked with mee, saying: What are
b.ZEC.4.5	Then the Angel that talked with me, answered and said vnto me; Knowest thou
b.ZEC.4.6	Then hee answered and spake vnto mee, saying; This is the word of the Lord
b.ZEC.4.7	Who art thou, O great mountaine? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plaine,
b.ZEC.4.8	Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying;
b.ZEC.4.9	The hands of Zerubbabel haue layed the foundation of this house: his hands
b.ZEC.5.1	Then I turned, and lift vp mine eyes, and looked, and behold, a flying roule.
b.ZEC.5.10	Then saide I to the Angel that talked with me, Whither do these beare the
b.ZEC.5.11	And he said vnto mee, To build it an house in the land of Shinar, and it
b.ZEC.5.2	And hee said vnto mee, What seest thou? and I answered, I see a flying roule,
b.ZEC.5.3	Then said hee vnto mee; This is the curse, that goeth forth ouer the face of
b.ZEC.5.4	I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hostes, and it shall enter into the
b.ZEC.5.5	Then the Angell that talked with me, went forth and said vnto me, Lift vp now
b.ZEC.5.6	And I said, What is it? and hee said, This is an Ephah that goeth forth. Hee
b.ZEC.5.7	And behold, there was lift vp a talent of lead: and this is a woman that
b.ZEC.5.8	And he said, This is wickednesse, and he cast it into the midst of the Ephah,
b.ZEC.5.9	Then lift I vp mine eyes, and looked, &amp; behold, there came out two women,
b.ZEC.6.1	And I turned, and lift vp mine eyes, and looked, and beholde, there came foure
b.ZEC.6.10	Take of them of the captiuitie, euen of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Iedaiah,
b.ZEC.6.11	Then take siluer, and golde, and make crownes, and set them vpon the head of
b.ZEC.6.12	And speake vnto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes, saying,
b.ZEC.6.13	Euen he shall build the temple of the Lord, and he shal beare the glory, and
b.ZEC.6.14	And the crownes shall bee to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Iedaiah, and to
b.ZEC.6.15	And they that are farre off, shall come and build in the Temple of the Lord,
b.ZEC.6.2	In the first charet were red horses, and in the second charet, blacke horses.
b.ZEC.6.3	And in the third charet white horses, and in the fourth charet grisled and bay
b.ZEC.6.4	Then I answered, and said vnto the Angel that talked with mee, What are these,
b.ZEC.6.5	And the Angel answered and said vnto me, These are the foure spirits of the
b.ZEC.6.6	The blacke horses which are therin, goe forth into the North countrey, and the
b.ZEC.6.7	And the baye went foorth, and sought to goe, that they might walke to and fro
b.ZEC.6.8	Then cried he vpon me, and spake vnto me, saying, Behold, these that goe
b.ZEC.6.9	And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
b.ZEC.7.1	And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of King Darius, that the word of the
b.ZEC.7.10	And oppresse not the widow, nor the fatherlesse, the stranger, nor the poore,
b.ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their
b.ZEC.7.12	Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should heare the
b.ZEC.7.13	Therefore it is come to passe, that as he cried, and they would not heare, so
b.ZEC.7.14	But I scattered them with a whirlewinde among all the nations, whom they knew
b.ZEC.7.2	When they had sent vnto the house of God, Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their
b.ZEC.7.3	And to speake vnto the priestes, which were in the house of the Lord of hosts,
b.ZEC.7.4	Then came the word of the Lord of hosts vnto me, saying,
b.ZEC.7.5	Speake vnto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye
b.ZEC.7.6	And when ye did eat, and when ye did drinke, did not ye eat for your selues,
b.ZEC.7.7	Should yee not heare the wordes, which the Lord hath cried by the former
b.ZEC.7.8	And the word of the Lord came vnto Zechariah, saying;
b.ZEC.7.9	Thus speaketh the Lord of hostes, saying, Execute true iudgement, and shew
b.ZEC.8.1	Againe the word of the Lord of hostes came to me, saying;
b.ZEC.8.10	For before these daies there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast,
b.ZEC.8.11	But now I will not bee vnto the residue of this people, as in the former
b.ZEC.8.12	For the seed shalbe prosperous: the Uine shall giue her fruit, and the ground
b.ZEC.8.13	And it shall come to passe, that as yee were a curse among the heathen, O
b.ZEC.8.14	For thus saith the Lord of hostes, As I thought to punish you, when your
b.ZEC.8.15	So againe haue I thought in these dayes to doe well vnto Ierusalem, and to
b.ZEC.8.16	These are the things that yee shall doe; Speake yee euery man the truth to
b.ZEC.8.17	And let none of you imagine euill in your hearts against his neighbour, and
b.ZEC.8.18	And the word of the Lord of hostes came vnto me, saying,
b.ZEC.8.19	Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The fast of the fourth moneth, and the fast of
