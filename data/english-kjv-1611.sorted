<seg id="b.HEB.9.22" type="verse">And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood: and without shedding

<seg id="b.MAR.7.23" type="verse">All these euill things come from within, and defile the man.
<seg id="b.MAR.7.24" type="verse">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of

<seg id="b.MAT.14.29" type="verse">And he said, Come. And when Peter was come downe out of the ship, he walked
<seg id="b.MAT.14.2" type="verse">And said vnto his seruants, This is Iohn the Baptist, hee is risen from the

<seg id="b.ROM.3.18" type="verse">There is no feare of God before their eyes.
<seg id="b.ROM.3.19" type="verse">Now we know that what things soeuer the Law saith, it saith to them who are

<seg id="b.ROM.3.23" type="verse">For all haue sinned, and come short of the glory of God,
<seg id="b.ROM.3.24" type="verse">Being iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Iesus

<seg id="b.ROM.3.29" type="verse">Is he the God of the Iewes only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the

<seg id="b.ROM.3.7" type="verse">For if the trueth of God hath more abounded through my lye vnto his glory; why
<seg id="b.ROM.3.8" type="verse">And not rather as wee be slanderously reported, and as some affirme that we

<seg id="b.ROM.4.10" type="verse">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in vncircumcision?
<seg id="b.ROM.4.11" type="verse">And hee receiued the signe of circumcision, a seale of the righteousnesse of

<seg id="b.ROM.4.13" type="verse">For the promise that he should be the heire of the world, was not to Abraham,
<seg id="b.ROM.4.14" type="verse">For if they which are of the law be heires, faith is made voide, and the

<seg id="b.ROM.4.1" type="verse">What shall we say then, that Abraham our father, as perteining to the flesh,
<seg id="b.ROM.4.20" type="verse">Hee staggered not at the promise of God through vnbeliefe: but was strong in
<seg id="b.ROM.4.21" type="verse">And being fully perswaded, that what he had promised, he was able also to
<seg id="b.ROM.4.22" type="verse">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousnesse.
<seg id="b.ROM.4.23" type="verse">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him:
<seg id="b.ROM.4.24" type="verse">But for vs also, to whome it shall bee imputed, if wee beleeue on him that
<seg id="b.ROM.4.25" type="verse">Who was deliuered for our offences, and was raised againe for our

<seg id="b.ROM.4.4" type="verse">Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
<seg id="b.ROM.4.5" type="verse">But to him that worketh not, but beleeueth on him that iustifieth the vngodly;
<seg id="b.ROM.4.6" type="verse">Euen as Dauid also describeth the blessednesse of the man, vnto whom God

<seg id="b.ROM.4.8" type="verse">Blessed is the man to whome the Lord will not impute sinne.
<seg id="b.ROM.4.9" type="verse">Commeth this blessednes then vpon the circumcision onely, or vpon the

<seg id="b.ROM.5.13" type="verse">For vntill the Law sinne was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there
<seg id="b.ROM.5.14" type="verse">Neuertheles, death reigned from Adam to Moses, euen ouer them that had not

<seg id="b.ROM.5.16" type="verse">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the iudgement was
<seg id="b.ROM.5.17" type="verse">For if by one mans offence, death raigned by one, much more they which
<seg id="b.ROM.5.18" type="verse">Therfore as by the offence of one, iudgment came vpon all men to
<seg id="b.ROM.5.19" type="verse">For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners: so by the obedience
<seg id="b.ROM.5.1" type="verse">Therefore being iustified by faith, wee haue peace with God, through our Lord
<seg id="b.ROM.5.20" type="verse">Moreouer, the Lawe entred, that the offence might abound: but where sinne

<seg id="b.ROM.5.2" type="verse">By whom also wee haue accesse by faith, into this grace wherein wee stand, and
<seg id="b.ROM.5.3" type="verse">And not onely so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation
<seg id="b.ROM.5.4" type="verse">And patience, experience: and experience, hope:
<seg id="b.ROM.5.5" type="verse">And hope maketh not ashamed, because the loue of God is shed abroad in our
<seg id="b.ROM.5.6" type="verse">For when wee were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the

<seg id="b.ROM.5.8" type="verse">But God commendeth his loue towards vs, in that, while we were yet sinners,
<seg id="b.ROM.5.9" type="verse">Much more then being now iustified by his blood, we shalbe saued from wrath
<seg id="b.ROM.6.10" type="verse">For in that he dyed, he dyed vnto sinne once: but in that hee liueth, hee
<seg id="b.ROM.6.11" type="verse">Likewise reckon yee also your selues to be dead indeed vnto sinne: but aliue
<seg id="b.ROM.6.12" type="verse">Let not sinne reigne therfore in your mortall body, that ye should obey it in

<seg id="b.ROM.6.14" type="verse">For sinne shall not haue dominion ouer you, for yee are not vnder the Law,
<seg id="b.ROM.6.15" type="verse">What then? shal we sinne, because wee are not vnder the Law, but vnder Grace?
<seg id="b.ROM.6.16" type="verse">Know ye not, that to whom yee yeeld your selues seruants to obey, his

<seg id="b.ROM.6.19" type="verse">I speake after the maner of men, because of the infirmitie of your flesh: for
<seg id="b.ROM.6.1" type="verse">What shall we say then? shall wee continue in sinne: that grace may abound?
<seg id="b.ROM.6.20" type="verse">For when yee were the seruants of sinne ye were free from righteousnesse.
<seg id="b.ROM.6.21" type="verse">What fruit had yee then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? for the

<seg id="b.ROM.6.2" type="verse">God forbid: how shall wee that are dead to sinne, liue any longer therein?
<seg id="b.ROM.6.3" type="verse">Know ye not, that so many of vs as were baptized into Iesus Christ, were

<seg id="b.ROM.6.7" type="verse">For he that is dead, is freed from sinne.
<seg id="b.ROM.6.8" type="verse">Now if we be dead with Christ, we beleeue that we shal also liue with him:
<seg id="b.ROM.6.9" type="verse">Knowing that Christ being raysed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no
<seg id="b.ROM.7.10" type="verse">And the commandement which was ordained to life, I found to be vnto death.
<seg id="b.ROM.7.11" type="verse">For sinne taking occasion by the commandement, deceiued me, and by it slew
<seg id="b.ROM.7.12" type="verse">Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Commandement holy, and iust, and good.
<seg id="b.ROM.7.13" type="verse">Was that then which is good, made death vnto me? God forbid. But sinne, that

<seg id="b.ROM.7.22" type="verse">For I delight in the Lawe of God, after the inward man.
<seg id="b.ROM.7.23" type="verse">But I see another Lawe in my members, warring against the Lawe of my minde,
<seg id="b.ROM.7.24" type="verse">O wretched man that I am: who shall deliuer me from the body of this death?
