b.HEB.3.1	Wherfore, ȝe holy breþeren þat beþ partyneres of an hefenlyche clepynge, byholde ȝe þe apostul &amp; þe byschop
b.HEB.3.10	Wherfore ich was wroþ to þis generacyoun, &amp; y seyde, Þese erreþ efermore in hure herte: bote þei knewen noȝt my

b.HEB.3.12	And breþeren, loke ȝe, wheþer

b.HEB.3.14	þoroȝ þe fallas of synne: for we beþ y-mad partyneres of Crist, ȝef þat we holdeþ þe bygynnynge of his substaunce
b.HEB.3.15	to þe ende: whyles it is y-sayd, To day ȝef ȝe hereþ his voys, ne harde ȝe noȝt ȝoure hertes, as þei duden in hure tarrynge.
b.HEB.3.16	For summe tarreden hym, bote noȝt alle þilke þat comen out of Egypt by Moyses.
b.HEB.3.17	Bote to whom was he wroþ fourty ȝere? bote to þilke þat synneden, whos careynes weren þrowen a-down in desert.
b.HEB.3.18	And to whom swor he þat þei schulden noȝt entren in-to his reste, bote to þilke þat weren vnbylefynge?
b.HEB.3.19	&amp; we seþ þat þei ne myȝte not entren in-to his reste for hure vnbylefynge.
b.HEB.3.2	of ȝoure knowlechynge, Iesus, þat is trewe to hym þat made hym, as Moyses was in al his hous.
b.HEB.3.3	Bote þes is worþi to muche more worschupe þan Moyses, as muche more as he is worþi þat makeþ an hous þan þe hous.
b.HEB.3.4	For eferich hous is y-buld of sum man; bote he þat made alle þinges he is God.
b.HEB.3.5	&amp; Moyses was trewe in al his hous as a serfaunt, in witnesse of þilke þinges þat weren to seyen þer-aftur.
b.HEB.3.6	Bote Crist is as a sone in his hous; whyche hous we beþ, ȝef it so be þat we holden oure trust &amp; þe ioye of oure hope sadlyche to þe ende.
b.HEB.3.7	Wherfore þe Holy Spiryt saiþ, To day ȝef ȝee

b.HEB.3.9	where þei prefeden me and syen my werkes fourty ȝeres.
b.HEB.4.1	And þerfore drede we, leste þe byheste be y-lafte to entren in-to his reste, leste þer be y-founde any of ous fayle þer-hennes .
b.HEB.4.10	For he þat entred in-to his reste, he rested from his werkes, as God dude from his werkes.
b.HEB.4.11	&amp; þerfore hyȝe we to entren in-to þat reste, þat no man falle in-to þat ensampel of
b.HEB.4.12	For Goddes word is lyfynge, &amp; spedful, &amp; more persynge þan eny two-egged swerd: for he comeþ to þe departynge of þe soule &amp; of þe spiryt, &amp; of þe myndes &amp; of þe maryȝes, &amp; knowere of þoȝtes &amp; of þe willes of þe herte. &amp; þer ne is no creature invysybel in his syȝt.
b.HEB.4.13	Bote alle þinges beþ naked &amp; opne to his yen to whom oure speche is.
b.HEB.4.14	And þerfore we þat haueþ a gret byschop þat haþ y-persed hefnes, Iesu Goddes Sone, holde we þe knowlechynge of oure hope.
b.HEB.4.15	For we ne haueþ no bischop þat ne may haue compassyoun to oure infirmytees, þat haþ ben y-tempted by alle Þinges to oure lyknesse wiþ-outen synne.
b.HEB.4.16	And þerfore go we wiþ trust to þe throne of his grace, þat we han mercy &amp; y-fynden grace in cofenabel help.
b.HEB.4.2	For it is y-told to ous, as it was to hem; bote þe word þat þei herden ne profyted hem noȝt, for it ne was noȝt y-medled wiþ bylefe.
b.HEB.4.3	For we þat haueþ bylefed schuleþ entren in-to reste , as he sayde, As ich haue y-swore in my wraþþe, þei ne schuleþ noȝt entren in-to my reste. And whanne in þe bygynnynge of þe worlde he hade parformed
b.HEB.4.4	his werkes, he saiþ in on place of þe sefeþe day in þis wyse,
b.HEB.4.5	God rested þe sefeþe day from alle his werkes; &amp; in þis place also, Þei ne schuleþ noȝt entren in-to my reste.
b.HEB.4.6	And for þat summe entreden in-to þat reste, &amp; þilke þat weren byfore to whom it was y-told, ne entrede noȝt in-to þat reste,
b.HEB.4.7	þerfore he setteþ a certeyn day, To day, in Dauyd seyenge as it is y-sayd abofen, aftur so muche tyme, To day ȝef ȝe hereþ his voys, ne harde ȝe noȝt ȝoure hertes.
b.HEB.4.8	And ȝef Iesus hade y-ȝefen hem reste, he ne wolde nefer aftur han y-spoken of þis day.
b.HEB.4.9	And þerfore þer is y-laft a day of reste to Goddes pepel.
b.HEB.5.1	For euerych byschop þat is y-taken up of men, he is y-ordeyned for men in þese þinges þat beþ to God: to offren

b.HEB.5.13	For eferich man þat is partener of mylk, he is wiþ-outen part of þe word of ryȝtfulnesse; for he is a smal chyld.

b.HEB.5.4	Ne no man takeþ worschype to hymselfen, bote he þat is y-cleped of God, as Aaron.
b.HEB.5.5	So Cryst ne claryfyed noȝt hym-selfen, þat he were y-maad a byschop, bote he þat spake to hym &amp; sayde, Þou art my sone, to day ich haue bygete þe.
b.HEB.5.6	As he seiþ in an oþer place, Þou art an euerlastynge prest aftur þe ordre of Melchysedech.
b.HEB.5.7	&amp; he in þe dayes of his flesch offred preyeres &amp; bysechynges wiþ gret cry &amp; wiþ teres to hym þat myȝte safen hym from deþ, &amp; for his reverence he was y-herd.
b.HEB.5.8	And ȝet whan he was Goddes sone, he lerned

b.HEB.6.11	&amp; we desyre þat eferich of ȝou schewe oftesyþes þe same bysynesse to

b.HEB.6.13	For God þat made his byheste to Abraham, for he ne hade no grettour to swere by, he swor by

b.HEB.6.15	And so wiþ his longe abydynge he get his byheste.
b.HEB.6.16	For men swereþ by hym þat is grettur þan þei beþ; &amp; þe confirmacyoun of þe ende of eferich ple is an oþ.
b.HEB.6.17	In þe whuche þing God, þat wolde schewen to eyres þe immebelnesse of his

b.HEB.6.3	&amp; þis we woleþ don, ȝef þat God wole leten us.

b.HEB.6.9	Bote, my lefeste breþeren, we trusteþ of ȝou beter þinges and neer to hele, þouȝ we speken
b.HEB.7.1	For þes Melchysedek , kyng of Salem, and a prest of þe heyeste God, þat mette wiþ Abraham whenne he come
